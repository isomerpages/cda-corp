<p><strong>About the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA)</strong> 
<br>
<br>The CDA is tasked with protecting Singapore from communicable diseases.
It will serve as the central authority for designing and implementing public
health policies to manage and control the threat of infectious diseases.
This includes strengthening Singapore's public health capabilities built
during the COVID-19 response, ensuring a unified command, and coordinated
approach across all situations, from routine disease control to future
outbreaks. To achieve this, the CDA will consolidate the various public
health functions currently housed within the Ministry of Health (MOH),
the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and the Health Promotion
Board (HPB). It will also oversee the National Public Health Laboratory.
Beyond domestic activities, the CDA aims to expand the Singaporeâ€™s global
outreach and collaboration with international partners who share similar
public health goals.</p>
