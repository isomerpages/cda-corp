<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Mpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the
genus Orthopoxvirus. Two clades exist: Clade I and Clade II.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox was historically known to be endemic in Central and Western Africa.
However, a global outbreak was first identified in May 2022, where cases
were reported in several locations that had not experienced with mpox.
Most cases were primarily driven by human-to-human close (including sexual)
contact. Globally, the number of mpox cases peaked in August 2022 and has
been on a downward trend. According to US Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention’s (US CDC) 2022–2023 Mpox data, a cumulative total of 93,500
laboratory-confirmed mpox cases has been reported.</p>
<p>As of December 2023, there were a total of 29 confirmed mpox cases reported
in Singapore (excluding an isolated case of mpox diagnosed in 2022).</p>
<p>On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing
outbreak of mpox to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC).</p>

<p>Mpox virus (Clade I; Clade II)</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Spread of mpox may occur when a person comes into close contact with an
infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir
for transmission to humans) in areas where there are animal reservoirs
(i.e. West and Central Africa), or more commonly, another infected human
(which was the most common mode in the 2022 outbreak), or materials contaminated
with the virus. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if
breaks are not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes
(eyes, nose, or mouth or anogenital mucosa).</p>
<p>Outside West and Central Africa, the outbreak of mpox had primarily affected
men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Up to 21 days (usually 6–16
days).</p>
<p>Infectious period: From onset of symptoms, until after all the scabs on
the skin have fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed underneath.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 'classic' mpox, more than 70% of infected persons are symptomatic,
and early symptoms of mpox include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle ache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lymphadenopathy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asthenia, or a general feeling of exhaustion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within one to three days after the onset of fever, infected persons will
develop a maculopapular rash, often starting from the face before becoming
generalised (centrifugal distribution), including involvement of palms
and soles in up to 75% of cases. The lesions progress to become vesicles
and then pustules, before crusting occurs in approximately 10 days, which
then spontaneously fall off. The disease is typically self-limiting, with
symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14 to 21 days. However,
the infection can be fatal, particularly in young children, with a reported
mortality rate of 1% to 10% during outbreaks.</p>
<p>In the 2022 outbreak, presentation had often been more atypical and variable
in terms of order of onset of fever versus rash, and extent of dissemination
of rash. The disease caused by mpox in the global 2022 outbreak had been
milder than in ‘classic’ mpox as the virus subtype (known as ‘clade’) is
different. &nbsp;About 72% of cases reported prodromal systemic symptoms
(e.g. fever, fatigue, muscle aches). Anal and genital lesions were commonly
reported, and lesions may initially appear quite non-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Atypical features include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Only a few or even just a single lesion, lesions which begin in the genital
or perineal/perianal area and do not spread further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lesions appearing at different (asynchronous) stages of development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance of lesions before the onset of fever, malaise, and other constitutional
symptoms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptomatology may masquerade as other sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), and mpox may occur concurrently with other STIs. Patients remain
infectious from the onset of fever until the vesicles/lesions have scabbed
over and have separated, with normal skin underneath (re-epithelialisation).</p>
