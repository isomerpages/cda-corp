<summary><strong>What is One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably
balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes
the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider
environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and inter-dependent.
The approach mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at
varying levels of society to work together to foster well-being and tackle
threats to health and ecosystems, while addressing the collective need
for clean water, energy and air, safe and nutritious food, taking action
on climate change, and contributing to sustainable development.</p>
<p>Central to this definition is taking One Health from theory to practice
through 4Cs: Communication, Coordination, Collaboration, and Capacity Building.
The approach is supported by four major international organisations, the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World
Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The concept of One Health is not new, as there has always been a need
for the human health, animal health and environmental health agencies to
work together to address cross-sectoral areas.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Key One Health Issues</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>One Health encompasses a wide range of interconnected issues affecting
humans, animals, and the environment. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Zoonotic diseases: Both emerging and re-emerging, as well as those endemic
to the Southeast Asian region.</p>

<li>
<p>Zoonotic diseases can jeopardise food production, affecting livelihoods
and economic stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contaminated water sources used for consumption, leisure, and other purposes
pose health risks to both people and animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMR pathogens can spread rapidly through various channels, including communities,
food chains, healthcare settings, and the environment, complicating treatment
for both humans and animals <em>(For more information on Singapore’s National Strategic Action Plan on AMR, please refer to: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ncid.sg/About-NCID/OurDepartments/Antimicrobial-Resistance-Coordinating-Office/Pages/default.aspx</a>)</em>

<h2>One Health approach in Singapore</h2>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Rationale for One Health approach in Singapore</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore made early moves to adopt the One Health approach in 2012 to
safeguard human, animal, and environmental health. This early adoption
has enhanced surveillance, preparedness, and response programmes. Building
on this, Singapore is committed to strengthen the One Health approach,
emphasising early prevention and detection of health risks especially infectious
diseases, by working closely with local and international partners on One
Health initiatives.</p>
<p>The past outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and group B streptococcus (GBS) have
further emphasised the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious and
zoonotic diseases. Southeast Asia, including Singapore, is a hotspot for
emerging diseases. The region has faced numerous public health emergencies
and outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and Nipah virus. To address
these challenges effectively, a multidisciplinary One Health approach is
crucial. This approach aims to balance and optimise the health of humans,
animals, plants, and the environment in a sustainable manner.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Singapore’s One Health framework and Establishment of One Health Office</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore’s One Health Framework, which comprise the Ministry of Health
(MOH), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), National Parks Board (NParks), National
Environment Agency (NEA) and PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, and
the One Health Office (OHO) established by the interim Communicable Diseases
Agency (CDA) under MOH work together on multisectoral collaborative initiatives
at the human-animal-environment interface to address public health concerns
and to prevent, prepare against, respond to, and learn from public health
threats.</p>
<p>The main body of One Health collaboration is the inter-agency One Health
Co-ordinating Committee (OHCC), which provides strategic direction and
sets priorities on One Health issues in Singapore. The OHCC champions inter-agency
coordination and collaboration on One Health issues, including the progress
and effectiveness of the One Health action plans. The OHCC comprises senior-level
representatives, ensuring high-level commitment and decision-making capacity.</p>
<p>The inter-agency One Health Working Group (OHWG) works under the direction
of the OHCC to formulate, coordinate, implement and review programmes,
initiatives, and action plans. Sub-working groups or project teams are
established as and when necessary, to focus on specific areas of One Health
issues.</p>
<p>The OHO serves as a coordinating secretariat for One Health initiatives
in Singapore. Its roles include acting as the primary point of contact
for external enquiries on One Health matters, facilitating inter-agency
collaboration, and supporting the implementation of One Health strategies
across relevant sectors.</p>

<summary><strong>International One Health initiatives: Quadripartite One Health Joint Plan of Action</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To inform and drive One Health efforts at the global level, the Quadripartite
One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA) was published by the Quadripartite
- FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH, in collaboration with the One Health High-Level
Expert Panel (OHHLEP). The plan establishes five priority areas for One
Health: enhancing capacities to strengthen systems, reducing risks from
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic epidemics and pandemics, controlling
and eliminating endemic zoonotic, neglected tropical and vector-borne diseases,
curbing the silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and integrating
the environment into One Health.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Regional One Health initiatives</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore actively participates in One Health initiatives regionally and
internationally, notably leading ASEAN initiatives such as drafting guidelines
on antimicrobial use in livestock and co-hosting the World One Health Congress
in 2022. The ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on One Health Initiative, adopted
in May 2023, establishes the ASEAN One Health Network (AOHN), commits to
analysing One Health implementation, and develops the ASEAN One Health
Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA). The AOHN, launched in June 2024, aims to
strengthen multisectoral collaboration with key functions including identifying
priorities, facilitating knowledge exchange, and promoting One Health perspectives.
The OH-JPA outlines the implementation plan for the One Health approach
in ASEAN Member States. Its objectives include guiding the AOHN, serving
as a reference for national plans, and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration.

<summary><strong>Case Studies</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore Field Epidemiology Training Program (S-FETP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Field Epidemiology Training Program (S-FETP) is a partnership
of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health and the NCID, hosting multi-sectoral
tiered training programmes for officers interested in field investigation
practice. They aim to ensure that health security extends beyond human
health to involve good hygiene, sanitation, environmental health, wildlife
ecology, animal and veterinary health, food safety, vector control and
social resilience.</p>
<p>To safeguard public health, we take a whole-of-society approach towards
capacity building. Training in field epidemiology methods, community engagement
and holistic education form vital parts of our defense against emerging
threats. S-FETP exists as a national asset with domain expertise and networking
to fulfil just such a role for professionals and the general public. Real
experiences of COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness have strengthened our
resolve to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and build community
readiness for outbreaks.</p>
<p>Master classes are conducted by experienced One Health trainers and epidemic
intelligence service faculty. Through group work, trainees investigate
wide-ranging issues and help create a profile of community health, which
in turn provide important clues to the at-risk groups in need of targeted
interventions. This training platform is specially designed to build a
sustainable field epidemiology workforce that meets the challenging future
of public health fraught with emerging threats.</p>

<p><strong>One Health Disease Prioritisation Workshop for One Health Agencies</strong>
</p>
<p>The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritisation (OHZDP) process utilizes
a multisectoral, One Health approach to prioritise zoonotic diseases of
greatest concern for One Health collaboration. This process brings together
representatives from human, animal, and environmental health sectors, and
other relevant partners to prioritise zoonotic diseases of greatest concern
that should be jointly addressed by human, animal, and environmental sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coordination of the OHZDP process, led by the National Parks Board
(NParks), culminated in a three-day zoonotic disease prioritisation workshop
from 19 to 21 April 2023 in Singapore. Participants from the One Health
agencies i.e. Ministry of Health (MOH), National Environment Agency (NEA),
NParks, Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the PUB Singapore (PUB)and external
facilitators from the US CDC and the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) attended the workshop. Joining them as external advisors, were experts
in various fields, ranging from environmental biotechnology to infectious
diseases.</p>
<p>The workshop aimed to a) prioritise zoonotic diseases in Singapore and
b) develop next steps and action plans to address the priority zoonotic
diseases in collaboration with the One Health agencies. Participants discussed
various zoonotic diseases, developed criteria for evaluation and scored
each disease based on the criteria. After three days of discussion, the
agencies finalised the list of zoonotic diseases in Singapore, and prioritised
them for inter-agency collaboration. Participants then discussed the next
steps and action plans to address the priority zoonotic diseases focused
on One Health coordination and workforce, communications and outreach,
preparedness and response planning, and laboratory and surveillance capacity
and capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore's National Strategic Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore developed the National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP) on Antimicrobial
Resistance (AMR) through a One Health approach, recognising the interconnected
nature of AMR across human, animal, food, and environmental sectors. The
plan is built on multisectoral collaboration, with the One Health AMR Working
Group (AMRWG) coordinating efforts across sectors. It focuses on five core
strategies: education; surveillance and risk assessment; research; prevention
and control of infection; and optimisation of antimicrobial use, underpinned
by principles of international collaboration and economic sustainability.</p>
<p>A five-year workplan was established to guide the NSAP's execution, with
the AMR Coordinating Office overseeing implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation in partnership with One Health agencies. Since its launch in
November 2017, several initiatives have been implemented, including joint
AMR and Antimicrobial Utilisation (AMU) surveillance reporting across One
Health agencies, the development of guidelines for prudent antimicrobial
use in companion animals, and the establishment of a One Health AMR Research
Programme focusing on cross-sector transmission pathways, knowledge and
practices of key players, and the socioeconomic impact of AMR in Singapore.</p>
<p>The NSAP has led to improved awareness of AMR, strengthened surveillance
systems, enhanced infection prevention and control measures, and improved
antibiotic stewardship across sectors.</p>
<p>This case study demonstrates Singapore's comprehensive, multisectoral
approach to combating AMR, emphasising collaboration and integration across
various health domains, and serves as a model for other countries seeking
to address the complex challenge of AMR through a One Health approach.</p>
