<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease that
is generally mild and self-limiting. HFMD is endemic in Singapore and can
affect all ages, particularly in children below 5 years of age.</p>

<summary><strong>&nbsp;Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is a common childhood viral illness that is mild and self-limiting.
Majority of infections occur at the pre-school age, although infection
can also occur in adults. Infection leads to specific immunity against
a particular virus but reinfection can occur through a different virus
from the enterovirus group.</p>
<p>Singapore experienced an epidemic of HFMD in Septemberâ€“October 2000 during
which 3,790 cases were reported, with EV-A71 the predominant virus. There
were four EV-A71-related deaths in 2000 and 3 in 2001. Reporting of HFMD
was made legally mandatory on 1 October 2000. HFMD is no longer legally
notifiable in Singapore as of 31 January 2019.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Numerous members of the Enteroviruses group of the family Picornaviridae,
e.g. coxsackievirus, echovirus, enterovirus (EV)-A71.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, direct contact with respiratory
droplets, saliva, vesicular fluid or indirectly via fomites contaminated
by secretions</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Typically 3 to 5 days, range is 2 days
to 2 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Few days before onset of prodromal
symptoms to about 1 week from the onset of illness. The maximum duration
of excretion is 3 to 4 weeks from the nasopharynx, and 6 to 12 weeks from
faeces</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>About 50-80% of HFMD infections are asymptomatic. HFMD commonly presents
with fever that lasts 2-3 days (up to 5 days) followed by a rash over the
palms, soles, dorsum of the feet, shins and buttocks. The rash start as
papules before becoming vesicular. The rash resolves in 7-10 days. Patients
also develop mouth ulcers over the soft/hard palate, uvula, buccal mucosa
and tongue. Some cases may have no rash but only ulcers, in which case
the patient is labelled as having herpangina, which is caused by the same
group of enteroviruses. There may be symptoms of cough or rhinitis.</p>
<p>Complications are rare, but include myocarditis, pulmonary oedema, acute
respiratory distress syndrome, viral pneumonitis, aseptic meningitis, brainstem
encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and secondary bacterial infection.
An important differential diagnosis is herpes simplex stomatitis, which
has ulcers more in the anterior mouth and visible externally.About 50-80%

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is typically diagnosed based on its clinical presentation.</p>
<p>In cases with atypical presentation or for public health investigations,
laboratory test may be considered such as throat and vesicles swab, which
are conducted using PCR or virus isolation techniques.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most patients can be managed at home with symptomatic measures (e.g. antipyretics).
Patients with signs and symptoms of severe disease or complications should
be referred to hospital for further management, e.g. prolonged fever, poor
feeding, and lethargy</p>
<p>Antibiotics are used when there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection
(especially Staphylococcus). There is anecdotal evidence for use of intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) in severe cases. However, it is not recommended as
a standard therapeutic option.</p>
<p>No specific management of contacts is required. Contacts are advised to
reinforce good hygiene practices.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To prevent the spread of HFMD, one is strongly encouraged to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Observe and practise good personal hygiene at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands regularly with soap, especially before handling food or
eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirty from coughing
or sneezing. If water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser
that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose the
soiled tissue into the bin immediately. Avoid touching your face, including
eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands after coughing or sneezing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sharing of food and drinks or eating utensils.</p>
</li>
<li>

<summary><strong>Notification</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is not a notifiable disease.</p>
<p>Note: While single cases are not notifiable, medical practitioners should
report events of public health significance e.g. cluster of infectious
diseases in the community through CDLENS (other significant disease).</p>
