<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused
by the herpes simplex virus (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 often spreads
through oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (known
as oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. HSV-2
often spreads through sexual contact and causes genital herpes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur
over time. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2,
but an increasing proportion has been attributed to HSV-1 infection, especially
among men who have sex with men (MSM) and young women. It is treatable
but not curable.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>According to 2016 data from the World Health Organization, approximately
67% of the global population under the age of 50 had a HSV-1 infection
(oral or genital), with the majority of these infections acquired during
childhood.</p>
<p>Genital herpes, caused by HSV-2, affects an estimated 13% of people aged
15 to 49 worldwide. HSV-2 infections are more common in women than in men,
attributed to the higher efficiency of sexual transmission from men to
women. Although the prevalence of HSV-2 increases with age, the majority
of new infections occur among adolescents.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The primary mode of transmission of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is via direct
contact of open lesions. It can occur through genital to genital, mouth
to genital, genital to anal and mouth to anal contact. HSV-1 and HSV-2
can also be shed from normal-appearing oral or genital mucosa or skin.</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>2–14 days.</p>
<p>Infectious period:<strong> </strong>Primary genital lesions are infectious
for 7–10 days, while those with recurrent disease may be infectious for
4–7 days with each episode. Cold sores may be infectious for up to seven
weeks after recovery from stomatitis. &nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most individuals with HSV infection experience either no or mild symptoms.
Consequently, they may transmit the virus to their partners unknowingly.</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes may either be primary or non-primary. Primary
genital herpes is defined as an infection occurring in persons with no
prior exposure to either HSV-1 or -2. Non-primary genital herpes is defined
as the first-genital episode in persons who have evidence of prior HSV
infection at another body site with either HSV-1 or -2.</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple
grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Females: lesions occur on the vulva, vagina, and cervix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males: lesions occur mainly on the prepuce and sub-preputial areas of
the penis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Healing of uncomplicated lesions take two to four weeks. Complications
may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Aseptic meningitis; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomic neuropathy resulting in urinary retention and autoinoculation
to fingers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrent episodes are usually less severe. The vesicles or erosions develop
on a single anatomical site and these usually heal within 10 days. Median
recurrence rate is approximately four recurrences per year for HSV-2 and
is four times more frequent than the recurrence rate for HSV-1.</p>
<p>HSV is a significant cause of proctitis in MSM, more commonly found in
HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM. Only 32% of MSM with HSV-associated
proctitis had visible external anal ulceration.</p>
