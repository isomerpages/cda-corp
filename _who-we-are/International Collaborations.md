<p>The Kirby Institute and the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) re have
signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding that formalises the collaborative
synergies and opportunities between the two organisations.</p>
<p>The agreement sets out the intention to collaborate on infectious disease
research across a range of research disciplines, including immunovirology
pathogenesis, surveillance activities, and biomedical interventions including
therapeutic studies.</p>
<p>The two organisations are leaders in their respective countries, and share
a common goal of understanding and minimising the impacts of bloodborne
viruses, antimicrobial resistance and respiratory pathogens, including
a major focus on COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness in each country and
our region more broadly. Already, NCID and Kirby Institute have worked
together via the global Strategies and Treatments for Respiratory Infections
and Viral Emergencies (STRIVE) network, with Tan Tock Sen Hospital being
one of the recruiting sites under the Sydney International Coordinating
Centre, led by the Kirby Institute’s Professor Gail Matthews.</p>
<p>“As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, infectious disease control is
best achieved through partnership and cooperation,” says Kirby Institute
Director, Scientia Professor Anthony Kelleher. “We are thrilled to formally
take forward this vision with our colleagues at the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. Through this Memorandum of Understanding, I am hopeful
that we can join forces to foster innovation, collaboration, and enhance
infectious disease research within our countries and across our region.”</p>
<p>Executive Director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Professor
Vernon Lee says, “We are proud to partner a world-renowned institution
like the Kirby Institute in strengthening our capabilities in infectious
disease research and implementation science in topics such as respiratory
infections, antimicrobial resistance and HIV. We are also looking forward
to exchanging knowledge and information on disease control programmes through
this partnership.”</p>
