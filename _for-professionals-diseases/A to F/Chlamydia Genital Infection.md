<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the
bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>that can occur in both men and
women. It is easily treated and cured with antibiotics.</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>Globally, it is the most common STI.&nbsp;The global prevalence among
people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for
men in 2020.&nbsp;Chlamydia genital infections occur frequently among sexually
active adolescents and young adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Singapore, chlamydia had the highest incidence followed by syphilis
and gonorrhoea among the three legally notifiable STIs in 2019 and 2020.
It was more commonly reported in men.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>Chlamydia can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse
with an infected individual. Semen does not have to be present to contract
or spread the infection. Sexually active teenage girls and young women
are more prone to develop chlamydial infection as the opening of the uterus
(cervix) is not fully matured.</p>
<p>An infected mother can also pass chlamydia to her baby during vaginal
delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> The incubation period is poorly defined
but is probably 5 to 14 days or longer.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Unknown but is presumed to last until
treatment is completed. If untreated, it may persist for several months.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>Many adult genital infections and most pharyngeal and rectal infections
caused by chlamydia are asymptomatic. Chlamydia often does not cause symptoms
especially in women. If symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and start
to show between one to three weeks after exposure to the bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In women, symptoms may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>abnormal vaginal discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding between menstrual periods or after sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pelvic pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>burning sensation when urinating</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In men, symptoms may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>burning when urinating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discharge from the penis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pain or discomfort in the testicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anal infection in women and men can cause</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serotypes L1-L3&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;can cause another
STI called lymphogranuloma venereum. The symptoms of this infection include
genital sores followed by fever and swelling of the lymph nodes in the
groin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several important complications may result from chlamydia infections,
including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility
in women, epididymo-orchitis in males, and conjunctivitis and reactive
arthritis in both sexes. Maternal-foetal transmission to newborns during
delivery may lead to neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nucleic acid-based amplification
testing (NAAT), a gold standard</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Females: cervical or vulvo-vaginal swabs are specimens of
choice, followed by first void urine (FVU)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Males: urine is the specimen of choice; FVU is as sensitive
as urethral swabs</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) can be used to test a range of specimens (urine, urethral, cervical,
rectal, pharyngeal)</p>

<p>Treatment and Management</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated chlamydia infections in adults:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Doxycycline</strong>&nbsp;100
mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for chlamydia infections in pregnancy:</p>
<p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Azithromycin 1g orally single dose</strong>
</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A test-of-cure is not
necessary with compliance to treatment with a tetracycline or azithromycin
has been completed, unless symptoms persist or reinfection is suspected</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test-of-cure is however
recommended after 4 weeks for infection in infants, children and pregnant
women, or when erythromycin was used</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-culture tests (e.g.,
NAATs) performed within 4 weeks of completing treatment may yield false
positive tests due to persistence of chlamydia antigens</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owing to the increased
risk of complications following repeat infection in females, rescreening
for reinfection may be indicated especially for high-risk females after
3 to 4 months</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serologic tests for
syphilis and HIV should be performed; if negative they should be repeated
at 3 months for syphilis and HIV, after the last high risk exposure</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annual screening for chlamydia symptoms and other STIs is recommended for all individuals who are sexually active.</a>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals with multiple
sex partners, change in sex partner, or engaging in unprotected sex should
consider regular screening</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More frequent screening
than annual might be indicated for certain individuals on the basis of
their risk behaviors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention of chlamydia:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent and correct
use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the number of
sex partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get tested for STIs
regularly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex partners of symptomatic
male patients within the last 60 days from symptom onset (or the most recent
sex partner if the last contact was &gt;60 days) should be screened and
treated for chlamydial infection epidemiologically. The look-back period
for contacts of female patients and asymptomatic males is longer, e.g.,
3 months.</p>
