This guidance provides recommendations and resources for healthcare professionals
to effectively manage travel-related health concerns.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Utilise <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/diseases-updates/travel-advisory" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOH Travel Advisories</a> to
assess destination-specific risks for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs),
vector-borne illnesses (e.g., dengue, malaria), and foodborne infections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vaccination Recommendations:</strong> Refer to the latest <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/nationally-recommended-vaccines" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Immunisation Programme guidelines</a> and
advocate for age-appropriate catch-up vaccinations for travelers with incomplete
immunization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prophylaxis and Chemoprophylaxis:</strong> Advise travelers on
appropriate insect repellents, safe food and water practices, and sun protection
with preventive measures such as antimalarial medications depending on
the travel destination.</p>
