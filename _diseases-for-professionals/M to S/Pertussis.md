<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory
infection<em>.</em> Pertussis spreads easily from person to person mainly
through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The disease is most
dangerous in infants, and is a significant cause of disease and death in
this age group.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Pertussis occurs worldwide with outbreaks occurring every 3-4 years. In
Singapore, pertussis vaccination is part of the National Childhood Immunisation
Programme. Increasing incidence in adolescents and adults (with occasional
community and school outbreaks) is noted and likely due to waning immunity.
Adolescents and adults with unrecognised pertussis are a reservoir of infection
for infants and children. Humans are the only known reservoir.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Bordetella pertussis</em>
</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets or direct contact with nasal
or throat secretions of an infected person.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Typically 9 to 10 days, range of 6
to 20 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Infectious for about 3 weeks, from
the catarrhal stage (about 1 week) through the paroxysmal cough stage (about
2 weeks) in an untreated patient. If antibiotics are initiated, the period
of infectiousness is usually ≤5 days after onset of treatment.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The disease can occur in both children and adults.</p>
<p>In unvaccinated children, the classic presentation has 3 stages:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Catarrhal stage</strong> (1-2 weeks): similar to an upper respiratory
tract infection with coryza and mild cough symptoms. Fever is often absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paroxysmal stage</strong> (2-6 weeks): increased cough with spells
of repetitive usually dry cough, followed by sudden inspiratory effort
(whoop) and post-tussive emesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convalescent stage</strong> (&gt;2 weeks): decreasing frequency
and severity of coughing episodes. Average duration of cough approximately
50 days.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Infants younger than 6 months may have cough without a typical whoop and
may have apnoea/respiratory distress. Adolescents and adults can have a
prominent hacking cough that lacks the characteristic whoop. Prior immunisation
can lead to atypical presentations.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All persons who have not been immunized are susceptible, and pertussis
can be severe in immune-naïve individuals of any age.</p>
<p>Infants aged &lt;12 months and immunocompromised persons are at highest
risk of severe disease. Pregnant women in their third trimester may be
a source of pertussis to their neonates.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Pertussis is diagnosed when a laboratory test detects <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> in
respiratory samples via PCR.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Antibiotic treatment is unlikely to shorten the duration of illness if
started more than one week after symptom onset, but it is beneficial in
shortening the infectious period and decreasing transmission. Macrolides
are the recommended first line of therapy.</p>
<p>Recommended antibiotic regimen for adults and adolescents:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Azithromycin: 500mg oral single dose, then 250mg daily for 4 days; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarithromycin: 500mg BD for 7 days; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erythromycin: 2g per day in 4 divided doses for 7-14 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative to macrolides: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) 1 double
strength tab BD for 14 days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended antibiotic regimen for children:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&gt;1 month old: PO clarithromycin 15mg/kg/day BD for 7 days; or azithromycin
10mg/kg/dose (maximum 500mg/dose) on first day, then 5mg/kg/dose (maximum
250mg/dose) for 4 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>≤1 month old: PO azithromycin 10mg/kg/day daily for 5 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative to macrolides (if ≥2 month): PO Bactrim 8mg/kg/day (TMP component)
BD for 14 days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Infection in infants under age 6 months may require hospitalisation due
to complication of hypoxaemia, apnoea or poor feeding.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients should be isolated. Suspect and confirmed cases should be removed
from the presence of young children and non-immunised infants until patients
have received at least 5 days of antibiotics. In the healthcare setting,
standard and droplet precaution should be applied until 5 days after initiation
of effective antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>Exposed household contacts younger than 7 years of age who are unvaccinated
or incompletely immunised may need to be quarantined till 21 days after
exposure, or till 5 days after index case and contact have received appropriate
antibiotics.</p>
<p>Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure (see Public Health
Resources section). Pertussis vaccination is part of the National Childhood
Immunisation Schedule (DTaP at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 18 months,
and Tdap booster at 10-11 years). All adolescents and adults, especially
healthcare workers, without documentation of having received a primary
series of at least 3 doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids should receive
a series of 3 doses of tetanus- and diphtheria containing vaccine, of which
1 dose, preferably the first, should be Tdap.</p>
<p>All pregnant women are recommended to receive Tdap between 16 and 32 weeks
of each pregnancy to maximise the maternal antibody response and transfer
of passive immunity to their infants, regardless of the interval since
the previous Td or Tdap vaccination. Tdap vaccination is recommended in
all pregnant women for the protection of infants against pertussis through
passive antibody transfer from mother to infant, who are at the highest
risk of pertussis-related complications.</p>
<p>Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is recommended for household contacts (regardless
of immunisation status) and contacts who are personally at high risk of
developing severe disease (e.g. children &lt;1 year) or are in close contact
with those at high risk of severe disease (e.g. pregnant women in their
third trimester who may be a source of pertussis to their neonates) within
3 weeks of exposure. Same drug regime as for treatment of cases can be
used for antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
<p>There is limited evidence for post-exposure vaccination, however contacts
are advised to keep up-to-date with their vaccinations to protect against
future exposure.</p>
