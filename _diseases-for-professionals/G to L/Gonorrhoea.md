<summary><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>,
an obligate human pathogen. The sites of infection include urethra, endocervix,
pharynx, rectum and conjunctiva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gonorrhoea is treatable and curable with antibiotics. However, <em>N. gonorrhoea </em>has
developed resistance to antibiotics, posing a challenge in the treatment
of gonorrhoea. Rational use of antibiotics is critical to decrease this
eminent threat.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 2020, World Health Organization estimated 82.4&nbsp;million new infections
with&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae&nbsp;</em>among adults aged 15 to 49 years.
Prevalence of gonorrhoea is highest among vulnerable populations such as
men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, transgender women and adolescents
and young people in high burden countries. Over the last decade, the incidence
of gonorrheal STIs has increased due to the rising number of antibiotic-resistant
strains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Singapore, gonorrhoea had the lowest incidence among the three legally
notifiable STIs in 2019 and 2020. It was more commonly reported in men.
No gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum cases were reported in 2019 and 2020.
Regarding gonorrhoea susceptibility, the percentage of gonorrhoea cultures
with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone decreased from 9.19% in 2019
to 7.33% in 2020. There was one resistant case detected in 2019 and no
cases detected in 2020. The percentage of gonorrhoea cultures resistant
to ciprofloxacin remained consistent at 81.1% in 2019 and 81.9% in 2020.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Gonorrhoea is usually transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse
with an infected individual. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhoea
to be transmitted or acquired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An infected mother can also pass gonorrhoea to her baby during vaginal
delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> average 3 to 5 days, sometimes longer</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>up to 7 days post treatment</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Gonorrhoea is characterised clinically by a profuse purulent discharge
from the affected genital site (&gt;80% in male urethritis, up to 50% in
female cervicitis), often accompanied by local pain or discomfort. However,
asymptomatic infection may occur in 10% of urethral infection, &gt;50%
of cervical infections and &gt;90% of pharyngeal infection and rectal infections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men and women may experience different symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In men, common symptoms include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pain or burn when urinating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a white, yellow or greenish discharge from the penis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>painful or swollen testes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they
can include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pain or burning when urinating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vaginal discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vaginal bleeding between periods or during sexual intercourse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infants born to mothers with gonorrhoea may develop an eye infection.
This causes redness, pain, soreness, ulcers and tearing. This is preventable
with eye medications for newborns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contiguous spread of the infection may lead to epididymo-orchitis, prostatitis,
endometritis and salpingo-oophoritis. Haematogenous spread results in disseminated
gonococcal infection (DGI).</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use if the relationship is not monogamous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who exchange sex for money or drugs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past history or current presence of other STIs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea is made on finding Gram-negative
intracellular diplococci in a smear of the discharge. Confirmatory diagnosis
is made by identification of the organism on culture media (e.g. modified
Thayer-Martin agar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAATs) (PCR) can be used as
diagnostic/screening tests on non-invasively collected specimens (urine
and self-taken vagina/pharyngeal/rectal swabs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect urethral and cervical,
pharyngeal and rectal gonorrhoea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because non-culture tests cannot provide anti-microbial susceptibility
results, in cases of persistent gonococcal infection after treatment or
potential resistant infections, clinicians should perform both culture
and anti-microbial susceptibility testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gonococcal complement fixation test (GC-CFT) should <strong><u>not</u></strong> be
used for diagnosing gonorrhoea.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the cervix,
urethra, or rectum:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ceftriaxone&nbsp;</strong>500 mg IM in a single dose plus <strong>Doxycycline&nbsp;</strong>100
mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the pharynx:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ceftriaxone&nbsp;</strong>500 mg IM in a single dose plus <strong>Doxycycline&nbsp;</strong>100
mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations in pregnancy:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cephalosporins in the recommended dosages are safe and effective in pregnancy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectinomycin can be administered to women who are unable to tolerate
Cephalosporins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simultaneous treatment for chlamydial infection with Azithromycin 1g orally
in a single is advocated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Test-of-cure and assessment for post-gonococcal urethritis (PGU) is performed
after 14 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test-of-cure culture tests are recommended in all cases at all sites,
especially for pharyngeal gonorrhoea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases of possible antibiotic resistance, cultures should be performed
with additional anti-microbial sensitivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patients with gonococcal ophthalmia should have cultures done daily whole
on therapy and again on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> days after
completion of therapy·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serologic tests
for syphilis and HIV should be performed; if negative they should be repeated
at 3 months after the last at-risk exposure.</p>
