<summary><strong>How is Yellow Fever Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yellow fever is transmitted through the bite of an infected <em>Aedes</em> mosquito.
Although there are no reported cases in Singapore, any importation of the
disease could result in the disease taking root here due to the presences
of the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito vector.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 3 to 6 days.</p>
