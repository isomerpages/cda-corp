<summary><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused
by&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>&nbsp;bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, the smallest known self-replicating bacterium
currently, is increasingly the cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU)
in men and an increasingly recognised cause of cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID) in women. It is a member of the <em>Mycoplasmataceae </em>family
and <em>Mollicutes </em>class of bacteria. It is not visible on Gram-stain
as it lacks a cell wall. Isolating <em>M. genitalium </em>is extremely challenging
as it is a fastidious organism and may require more than one month to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>M. genitalium </em>has been isolated from multiple tissue sites but
its association with clinical disease appears to be limited to the urogenital
tract. Studies in both male and female non-human primates, in which genital
infection developed following urogenital inoculation of <em>M. genitalium</em>,
demonstrate its pathogenicity. <em>M. genitalium </em>can persist for months
or years in infected individuals.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Available evidence showed that the summary prevalence was 1.3% in countries
with higher levels of development and 3.9% in countries with lower levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local situation</p>
<p>The lack of a cell wall renders <em>M. genitalium </em>resistant to antibiotics
which target cell wall synthesis, such as penicillins and other beta-lactams. <em>M. genitalium </em>is
generally susceptible in vitro to the macrolides (azithromycin &gt; erythromycin
and clarithromycin), fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and clindamycin,
although resistance is a growing issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azithromycin has at least 100-fold more activity against this organism
than the tetracyclines or most fluoroquinolones. However, strains of <em>M. genitalium </em>with
resistance to azithromycin are increasingly reported following the use
of single dose azithromycin in patients with non-gonococcal urethritis
(NGU). In addition, reports of mutations in <em>M. genitalium </em>genes
parC and gyrA, which are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance, have
also surfaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no commercially available resistance tests in Singapore for <em>M. genitalium </em>at
the moment.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>MG causes symptomatic and asymptomatic urethritis among men. When present,
the typical symptoms of MG<em>-</em>urethritis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dysuria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urethral pruritus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purulent or mucopurulent urethral discharge</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among women, MG&nbsp;may cause cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID), though individuals with cervicitis due to MG&nbsp;often are asymptomatic.
When present, symptoms associated with MG cervicitis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Vaginal discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaginal itching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dysuria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pelvic discomfort</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If untreated, PID may lead to:</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In the clinical setting, the microbiological diagnosis of <em>M. genitalium </em>is
infrequently made because of the absence of commercially-available, FDA-cleared
diagnostic tests. However, if available, the diagnosis of <em>M. genitalium </em>infection
may be made through detection of the organism using nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAAT). The preferred specimens are a first-void urine sample in
men/women and a cervical swab in women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAATs are the only clinically useful method of detecting <em>M. genitalium </em>but
are not widely available locally; the DSC clinic provides a PCR test with
a turnaround-time of 7 working days. There are no standardised serological
tests for <em>M. genitalium.</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>Clinical suspicion of infection by <em>M. genitalium </em>should be high,
and treatment can be given empirically even before laboratory confirmation.
Our approach to therapy of <em>M. genitalium </em>depends on the timing
of presentation, the availability of <em>M. genitalium </em>PCR testing,
and the treatment history. Treatment for <em>M. genitalium </em>can be considered
in patients with NGU or MPC with a negative chlamydial PCR who continue
to have symptoms and signs.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Empiric treatment for urethritis, cervicitis, and PID includes therapy
for <em>C. trachomatis </em>with doxycycline or azithromycin. Both agents
have activity against <em>M. genitalium</em>, although clinical evidence
suggests that azithromycin is superior to doxycycline. However high rates
(50%) of macrolide resistance and fluoroquinolone mutations (20%) in <em>M. genitalium </em>have
been reported.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recommended regimens if macrolide resistant OR resistance testing not
available OR failed macrolide treatment:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Doxycycline 100mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin
400mg orally daily for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens if macrolide sensitive:Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Doxycycline 100mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by azithromycin
1g orally STAT then 500mg orally daily for 3 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens if failed macrolide and fluoroquinolone treatment:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Minocycline 100mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doxycycline 100mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days <em>plus </em>pristinamycin
1g 3 times/day for 10 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pristinamycin 1g orally 4 times/day for 10 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for complicated infection (PID/epididymo-orchitis):</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Moxifloxacin 400mg orally daily for 14 days</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Prevention of MG:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Not having sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>Although there are no guidelines for partner referral and treatment, it
is reasonable to screen all sexual partners of laboratory-confirmed cases
of <em>M. genitalium </em>and treat if positive. If screening of sexual
partners of index patients with confirmed <em>M. genitalium </em>is not
possible, empirically treating for <em>M. genitalium </em>given the evidence
of sexual transmission of this organism. Although the incubation period
of this pathogen remains undefined, screening should target sexual partners
in the past 60 days</p>
