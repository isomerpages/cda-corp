<summary><strong>What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Antimicrobials is the collective term for medicines that are used to prevent
and treat infections in humans, animals and plants. These medicines include
antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics for bacteria, viruses,
fungi and parasites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AMR develops when microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and
parasites, are exposed to antimicrobials and, in order to protect themselves
against antimicrobials, undergo changes that prevent these medicines from
working effectively against them.</p>

<summary><strong>Why is AMR a Concern?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As a result of developing resistance, antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms
no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. This makes infections harder
to treat, increasing the risks of developing severe illness and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms emerging and spreading globally,
AMR threatens our ability to prevent and treat an ever-increasing range
of infections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without effective antimicrobials for prevention and treatment of infections,
medical procedures (from transplants, chemotherapy to surgeries) can become
life-threatening. Around the world, healthcare systems are increasingly
being put at risk.</p>

<summary><strong>When are Antibiotics Required?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Antibiotics kill or slow the growth of bacteria. They are used to treat
bacterial infections such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Strep throat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whooping cough; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuberculosis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>However, antibiotics <strong>DO NOT</strong> work on viruses that cause
viral infections, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Flu (Influenza);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common cold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID-19; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HFMD (Hand Foot Mouth Disease).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Viral symptoms usually go away with time and symptomatic relief.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When your doctor prescribes antibiotics to treat your infection, the benefits
outweigh the risks. However, side effects may occur as antibiotics destroy
both good and bad bacteria. Common side effects include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nausea or vomiting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diarrhoea;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloating; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Your doctor may then prescribe probiotic tablets along with your antibiotic
to maintain and restore good bacteria. If you develop other symptoms due
to the antibiotic or/and your side effects become worrisome, you should
consult a doctor immediately.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the Consequences of Misusing Antibiotics?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. This
reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infections, which
can lead to undesirable consequences:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Drug-resistant bugs: </strong>Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics
– developing resistance to the drugs designed to kill them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Increased medical costs: </strong>Complications caused by antibiotic-resistant
bacteria can increase hospital stay lengths and medical care costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Increased health risks: </strong>Without effective antibiotics
illnesses caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are harder or impossible
to treat, which can lead to disability and death.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Left unchecked, AMR could cause as many as 10 million deaths worldwide
by 2050 – higher than death attributed to diabetes (1.5 million) and cancer
(8.2 million).</p>

<summary><strong>How Can You Protect Yourself and Your Loved Ones From Infections?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>An infection occurs when the invading microorganisms overcome the body’s
immune defences. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms
are harder to treat as the usual antimicrobials may not work. Instead,
stronger antimicrobials must be used, which may be more expensive and lead
to further resistance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Protect yourself and loved ones against infections with these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Practice good hygiene habits</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/amr_public_protect_1.png">
</div>
<p>Our hands are in contact with germs, and we use our hands in our daily
routine such as eating. Animals are also capable of carrying germs which
can cause sickness in humans, and vice versa. Thus, regular hand washing
with soap for <strong>at least 20 seconds</strong> is one of the easiest
and most effective ways to get rid of germs, prevent infection and preventing
germs from spreading to others.</p>

keep healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Reduce infections</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/amr_public_protect_2.png">
</div>
<p>Stay home if you are unwell. This helps to prevent the spread of bacteria
and viruses and protect the community and our loved ones.</p>
<p>If you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough, wear a mask when you
are around others. Remember to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>If you have a wound and abrasion, make sure they are disinfected and covered
to prevent further infection.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Get vaccinated</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/amr_public_protect_3.png">
</div>
<p>Several infectious diseases are preventable. Vaccination strengthens our
immunity against these diseases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are your vaccinations up to date? Learn about the recommended vaccines
for your age group <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/163/vaccinate" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Take antibiotics responsibly</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/amr_public_protect_4.png">
</div>
<p>Not all illnesses require antibiotics. For instance, antibiotics do not
treat viral infections such as the cold, flu and most upper respiratory
tract infections.</p>
<p>Follow your doctor's advice for medication:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not demand for antibiotics from your doctor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the recommended dosage and duration of treatment prescribed by
your doctor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never share antibiotics with others or use leftover antibiotics; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never save antibiotics for later use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;To fight viral infections, you need time, not antibiotics.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Practice Food Safety</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/amr_public_protect_5.png">
</div>
<p>Proper food handling and cooking can reduce the risk of infection by harmful
microorganisms. The risk of foodborne illnesses can be mitigated by ensuring
good hand hygiene, washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cooking
or consuming, and cooking food thoroughly to eliminate harmful bacteria.</p>

<p><strong>Maintain good pet health</strong>

<p>People and pets share lives and living spaces, and could also share resistant
microorganisms. Keep your pet healthy through vaccination, regular parasite
and deworming treatment, proper nutrition and exercise, regular health
checks by a veterinarian and good hygiene practices.</p>
