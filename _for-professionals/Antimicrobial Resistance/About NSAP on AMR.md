<h2>National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP) on AMR</h2>
<p>Launched in 2017, Singaporeâ€™s NSAP<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[MA(1]</a>&nbsp;on AMR is aligned with global objectives in the <a href="https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WHO Global Action Plan on AMR</a>.
This includes improving AMR awareness, optimising the use of antimicrobials,
strengthening surveillance and research, and reducing infections.</p>
<p>The NSAP adopts a One Health approach to combat AMR through cross-sectoral
collaboration. It brings the Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Promotion
Board (HPB), National Parks Board (NParks), National Environment Agency
(NEA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and PUB, Singapore's National Water
Agency, to coordinate and drive AMR efforts across the human, environmental,
food, and animal sectors.</p>
<p>The NSAP aims to reduce the emergence and prevent the spread of drug-resistant
organisms through five core strategies:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raising awareness and understanding of AMR and appropriate antimicrobial
use through <strong><em>Education</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the levels, distribution and trends of resistant organisms
and antimicrobial use through regular <strong><em>Surveillance and Risk Assessment</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filling in gaps in knowledge and improving our understanding of the AMR
situation through <strong><em>Research</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the spread of drug-resistant organisms through effective <strong><em>Prevention and Control of Infections</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing inappropriate use and preserving the effectiveness of medicines
through the <strong><em>Optimisation of Antimicrobial Use</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
