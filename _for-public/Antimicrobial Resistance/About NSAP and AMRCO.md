<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In November 2017, the&nbsp;National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP)&nbsp;on
AMR was jointly formulated by the former Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority
of Singapore (AVA); the Ministry of Health (MOH); the National Environment
Agency (NEA); and PUB, Singaporeâ€™s National Water Agency.</p>
<p>The plan provides a roadmap of existing gaps and priorities for intervention
and sets a framework for a national response to AMR across the human, animal,
food and environment sectors. It builds on many years of work to combat
AMR in Singapore and unifies existing initiatives mounted across the sectors.</p>
<p>The Antimicrobial Resistance Coordinating Office (AMRCO) was established
in August 2018 to oversee the implementation, monitoring and evaluation
of the NSAP on AMR. It works with the human, animal, food and environmental
sectors and other key strategic partners to drive progress in reducing
the emergence&nbsp;and prevent&nbsp;the spread of resistant organisms under
each core strategy.</p>
