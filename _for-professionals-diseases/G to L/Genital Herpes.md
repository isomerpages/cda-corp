<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused
by the</p>
<p>herpes simplex virus (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HSV-1: often spreads
through oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (known
as oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HSV-2: often spreads
through sexual contact and causes genital herpes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over
time. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, but an
increasing proportion has been attributed to HSV-1 infection, especially
among men who have sex with men (MSM) and young women. It is treatable
but not curable.</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>According to the 2016 data from the World Health Organization, approximately
67% of the global population under the age of 50 had HSV-1 infection (oral
or genital), with the majority of these infections acquired during childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Genital herpes, caused by HSV-2, affects an estimated 13% of people aged
15-49 worldwide. HSV-2 infections are more common in women than in men,
attributed to the higher efficiency of sexual transmission from men to
women. Although the prevalence of HSV-2 increases with age, the majority
of new infections occur among adolescents.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>The primary mode of transmission of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is via direct
contact of open lesions. It can occur through genital to genital, mouth
to genital, genital to anal and mouth to anal contact. HSV-1 and HSV-2
can also be shed from normal-appearing oral or genital mucosa or skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period: </strong>2 to 14 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Primary genital lesions are infective
for 7-10days, while those with recurrent disease may be infective for 4-7
days with each episode. Cold sores may be infective for up to 7 weeks after
recovery from stomatitis. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>Most individuals with HSV infection experience either no symptoms or only
mild symptoms. Consequently, they may transmit the virus to their partners
unknowingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes may either be primary or non-primary. Primary
genital herpes is defined as infection occurring in persons with no prior
exposure to either HSV type 1 or 2. Non-primary genital herpes is defined
as the first-genital episode in persons who have evidence of prior HSV
infection at another body site with either HSV type 1 or 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple
grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Females: lesions occur
on the vulva, vagina and cervix</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Males: lesions occur
mainly on the prepuce and sub-preputial areas of the penis</p>
<p>Healing of uncomplicated lesions take 2 to 4 weeks. Complications may
include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aseptic meningitis</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autonomic neuropathy
resulting in urinary retention and autoinoculation to fingers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recurrent attacks are usually less severe than the first episode. The
vesicles or erosions develop on a single anatomical site and these usually
heal within 10 days. Median recurrence rate is approximately four recurrences
per year for HSV-2 and is four times more frequent than the recurrence
rate for HSV-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HSV is a significant cause of proctitis in MSM, more commonly found in
HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM. Only 32% of MSM with HSV-associated
proctitis had visible external anal ulceration.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited,
recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated
with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Tests for clinical diagnosis include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nucleic acid-based amplification
testing (NAAT) as the preferred method for genital herpes</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) is the test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the
central nervous system and systemic infections (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis,
and neonatal herpes).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type-specific serologic
tests (TSSTs) can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the
absence of genital lesions</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serology may be useful
in certain clinical situations:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Recurrent genital symptoms or atypical symptoms with negative
HSV PCR or culture</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory
confirmation</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Asymptomatic partners of serodiscordant couples of genital
herpes, including women who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; STI evaluation for persons with multiple sexual partners,
persons with HIV infection and MSM at increased risk for HIV acquisition</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Pregnant women presenting with first episode of genital
herpes in the third trimester</p>

<p><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</p>
<p>For general treatment measures, patients are advised to clean the affected
areas with normal saline, take analgesic and/or receive treatment for any
secondary bacterial infection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms
of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes,
or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither
eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences
after the drug is discontinued.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for first episode of genital herpes:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Acyclovir&nbsp;</strong>400
mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Valacyclovir&nbsp;</strong>1g
orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Famciclovir&nbsp;</strong>250
mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For optimal benefit, the treatment should be started within 48 to 72 hours
of onset of lesions, when new lesions continue to form or when symptoms
and signs are severe. Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete
after 10 days of therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recurrent genital herpes:</p>
<p>Most recurrent attacks are mild and can be managed with general measures.
Routine use of specific treatment is not necessary. Management should be
decided together with the patient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<p>Counselling of infected persons and their sex partners is crucial for
management. The goals of counselling are to help patients cope with the
infection and prevent sexual and perinatal transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>Prevention of genital herpes:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstain from sexual
activity during symptomatic periods</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent and correct
use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity &nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the number of
sex partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get tested for STIs
regularly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual partners of patients
with genital herpes are likely to benefit from evaluation and counselling.
They should be questions on a history of typical and atypical genital lesions,
encouraged to examine themselves for lesions and seek medical attention
early if lesions appear. TSSTs may be useful in counselling couples.</p>
