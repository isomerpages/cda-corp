<h2><strong>National Tuberculosis Programme</strong></h2>
<p>The National Tuberculosis (TB) Programme (NTBP),&nbsp;previously known
as the Singapore TB Elimination Programme (STEP), was launched by MOH in
1997 to strengthen the national TB prevention and care&nbsp;efforts in
response to the then decade-long stagnation in the country's TB incidence
rate.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> A TB-free Singapore with people-centred care</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Protect the people of Singapore from TB through
<br>- Prompt diagnosis and management;
<br>- Effective contact tracing and screening;
<br>- Strong partnerships; and
<br>- Sustainable strategies
<br>
</p>
<p>The NTBP Registry administers the National TB notification registry and
the national Treatment Surveillance Module which monitors the treatment
progress and outcome of all TB cases in the country.</p>
<p>The TB Control Unit (TBCU) being the clinical arm of NTBP, functions as
the national referral centre for TB evaluation and treatment. It manages
80% of the country's TB cases, the vast majority of whom are treated under
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).&nbsp; Another major function of the TBCU
is the screening of close contacts in households, workplaces and congregate
settings (such as schools and prisons) for active and latent TB, and provision
of preventive therapy for contacts found to have latent TB infection.</p>
