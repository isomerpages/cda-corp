<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>

<p>Zika virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans via the bite of an infective
Aedes mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the common species
found locally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Infection
during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects, including microcephaly
(baby’s head is much smaller than expected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexual transmission has also been reported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incubation period: 3-14 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infectious period: From two days before onset of illness up to three months
after onset.</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop symptoms. One
in five cases may present with the following symptoms:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conjunctivitis (red eyes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symptoms usually appear within 3 to 14 days of being bitten by an infected
Aedes mosquito. They tend to be mild and can last 4 to 7 days.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Although rare, serious neurological complications and foetal abnormalities
have been associated with Zika virus infection. While there is currently
no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to get the Zika virus infection,
the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected, as
the Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly in a small number of unborn
foetuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnant women with symptoms of possible Zika virus infection should seek
medical attention immediately and consult their Obstetrics and Gynaecology
(O&amp;G) doctor.</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Zika virus can be identified in blood or urine samples of symptomatic
individuals via polymerase-chain reaction (PCR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zika serological tests should not be used for diagnosis of Zika virus
infection due to cross-reactivity with dengue virus.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>

<li>
<p>There is no specific treatment or vaccine for Zika virus infection. The
treatment is generally supportive.</p>

to treat Zika virus infection.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>If you are a man planning a pregnancy or your partner is already pregnant:</strong> You
should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>

<p><u>Zika And Everyone</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Preventing the breeding of the Aedes mosquito remains the most effective
way to control the spread of the Zika virus infection in Singapore. You
can proactively take measures to protect yourself, your family, and your
co-workers by removing stagnant water in and around your home and workplace
to prevent mosquito breeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also prevent mosquito bites by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Staying in rooms which are well-screened or air-conditioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing long, covered clothing that cover most of your body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying an effective insect repellent, such as those containing DEET,
Picaridin or IR3535 as the active ingredient regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>During Pregnancy</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you, or your sexual partner, work, study or live in an affected area,
you should adopt safe sexual practices (e.g. consistent and correct use
of condoms during sex) or consider abstinence throughout your pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your sexual partner has tested positive for Zika, you should consult
your doctor and inform him/her of your possible exposure to Zika so that
he/she can arrange for you to be tested. Do keep in mind that WHO’s May
2016 guidelines do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic
pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss further with your
doctor.</p>

<p><u>For Couples Planning Pregnancy</u>

<p><em><u>If the woman is symptomatic </u></em><u>(with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain)</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>She should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive
for Zika, she should practice safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual
intercourse for at least two months after recovery, before trying to conceive.</p>
