<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused
by the herpes simplex virus (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 often spreads
through oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (known
as oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. HSV-2
often spreads through sexual contact and causes genital herpes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur
over time. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2,
but an increasing proportion has been attributed to HSV-1 infection, especially
among men who have sex with men (MSM) and young women. It is treatable
but not curable.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>According to 2016 data from the World Health Organization, approximately
67% of the global population under the age of 50 had a HSV-1 infection
(oral or genital), with the majority of these infections acquired during
childhood.</p>
<p>Genital herpes, caused by HSV-2, affects an estimated 13% of people aged
15 to 49 worldwide. HSV-2 infections are more common in women than in men,
attributed to the higher efficiency of sexual transmission from men to
women. Although the prevalence of HSV-2 increases with age, the majority
of new infections occur among adolescents.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The primary mode of transmission of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is via direct
contact of open lesions. It can occur through genital to genital, mouth
to genital, genital to anal and mouth to anal contact. HSV-1 and HSV-2
can also be shed from normal-appearing oral or genital mucosa or skin.</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>2–14 days.</p>
<p>Infectious period:<strong> </strong>Primary genital lesions are infectious
for 7–10 days, while those with recurrent disease may be infectious for
4–7 days with each episode. Cold sores may be infectious for up to seven
weeks after recovery from stomatitis. &nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most individuals with HSV infection experience either no or mild symptoms.
Consequently, they may transmit the virus to their partners unknowingly.</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes may either be primary or non-primary. Primary
genital herpes is defined as an infection occurring in persons with no
prior exposure to either HSV-1 or -2. Non-primary genital herpes is defined
as the first-genital episode in persons who have evidence of prior HSV
infection at another body site with either HSV-1 or -2.</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple
grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Females: lesions occur on the vulva, vagina, and cervix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males: lesions occur mainly on the prepuce and sub-preputial areas of
the penis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Healing of uncomplicated lesions take two to four weeks. Complications
may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Aseptic meningitis; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomic neuropathy resulting in urinary retention and autoinoculation
to fingers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrent episodes are usually less severe. The vesicles or erosions develop
on a single anatomical site and these usually heal within 10 days. Median
recurrence rate is approximately four recurrences per year for HSV-2 and
is four times more frequent than the recurrence rate for HSV-1.</p>
<p>HSV is a significant cause of proctitis in MSM, more commonly found in
HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM. Only 32% of MSM with HSV-associated
proctitis had visible external anal ulceration.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexual contact with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging in unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex;</p>

<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History or current presence of other STIs.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited,
recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated
with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation.</p>
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAAT) as the preferred method
for genital herpes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the test of choice for diagnosing HSV
infections affecting the central nervous system and systemic infections
(e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type-specific serologic tests (TSSTs) can be used to aid in the diagnosis
of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serology may be useful in certain clinical situations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Recurrent genital symptoms or atypical symptoms with negative HSV PCR
or culture;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asymptomatic partners of serodiscordant couples of genital herpes, including
women who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STI evaluation for persons with multiple sexual partners, persons with
HIV infection and MSM at increased risk for HIV acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnant women presenting with first episode of genital herpes in the
third trimester.</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>For general treatment measures, patients are advised to clean the affected
areas with normal saline, take analgesics, and/or receive treatment for
any secondary bacterial infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms
of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes,
or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither
eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences
after the drug is discontinued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for first episode of genital herpes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Acyclovir&nbsp;</strong>400mg orally 3 times a day, for 7–10 days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Valacyclovir&nbsp;</strong>1g orally 2 times a day, for 7–10 days;
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Famciclovir&nbsp;</strong>250mg orally 3 times a day, for 7–10
days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For optimal benefit, the treatment should be started within 48 to 72 hours
of onset of lesions, when new lesions continue to form or when symptoms
and signs are severe. Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete
after 10 days of therapy.</p>
<p>Recurrent genital herpes:</p>
<p>Most recurrent attacks are mild and can be managed with general measures.
Routine use of specific treatment is not necessary. Management should be
decided with the patient.</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<p>Counselling of infected persons and their sex partners is crucial for
management. The goals of counselling are to help patients cope with the
infection and prevent sexual and perinatal transmission.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Prevention of genital herpes:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Abstain from sexual activity during symptomatic periods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<p>Sexual partners of patients with genital herpes are likely to benefit
from evaluation and counselling. They should be assessed for history of
typical and atypical genital lesions, encouraged to self-examine for lesions
and seek medical attention early if lesions appear. TSSTs may be useful
in counselling couples.</p>
