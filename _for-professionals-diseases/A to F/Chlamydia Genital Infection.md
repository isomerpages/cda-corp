<summary><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the
bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>that can occur in both men and
women. It is easily treated and cured with antibiotics.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Globally, it is the most common STI.&nbsp;The global prevalence among
people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for
men in 2020.&nbsp;Chlamydia genital infections occur frequently among sexually
active adolescents and young adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Singapore, chlamydia had the highest incidence followed by syphilis
and gonorrhoea among the three legally notifiable STIs in 2019 and 2020.
It was more commonly reported in men.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>
</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Chlamydia can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse
with an infected individual. Semen does not have to be present to contract
or spread the infection. Sexually active teenage girls and young women
are more prone to develop chlamydial infection as the opening of the uterus
(cervix) is not fully matured.</p>
<p>An infected mother can also pass chlamydia to her baby during vaginal
delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> The incubation period is poorly defined
but is probably 5 to 14 days or longer.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Unknown but is presumed to last until
treatment is completed. If untreated, it may persist for several months.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Many adult genital infections and most pharyngeal and rectal infections
caused by chlamydia are asymptomatic. Chlamydia often does not cause symptoms
especially in women. If symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and start
to show between one to three weeks after exposure to the bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In women, symptoms may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>abnormal vaginal discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding between menstrual periods or after sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pelvic pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>burning sensation when urinating</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In men, symptoms may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>burning when urinating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discharge from the penis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pain or discomfort in the testicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Anal infection in women and men can cause</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serotypes L1-L3&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;can cause another
STI called lymphogranuloma venereum. The symptoms of this infection include
genital sores followed by fever and swelling of the lymph nodes in the
groin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several important complications may result from chlamydia infections,
including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility
in women, epididymo-orchitis in males, and conjunctivitis and reactive
arthritis in both sexes. Maternal-foetal transmission to newborns during
delivery may lead to neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who exchange sex for money or drugs</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAAT), a gold standard</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Females: cervical or vulvo-vaginal swabs are specimens of choice, followed
by first void urine (FVU)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males: urine is the specimen of choice; FVU is as sensitive as urethral
swabs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to test a range of specimens
(urine, urethral, cervical, rectal, pharyngeal)</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated chlamydia infections in adults:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Doxycycline</strong>&nbsp;100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for chlamydia infections in pregnancy:</p>
<p><strong>Azithromycin 1g orally single dose</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A test-of-cure is not necessary with compliance to treatment with a tetracycline
or azithromycin has been completed, unless symptoms persist or reinfection
is suspected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test-of-cure is however recommended after 4 weeks for infection in infants,
children and pregnant women, or when erythromycin was used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-culture tests (e.g., NAATs) performed within 4 weeks of completing
treatment may yield false positive tests due to persistence of chlamydia
antigens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owing to the increased risk of complications following repeat infection
in females, rescreening for reinfection may be indicated especially for
high-risk females after 3 to 4 months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serologic tests for syphilis and HIV should be performed; if negative
they should be repeated at 3 months for syphilis and HIV, after the last
high risk exposure</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Annual screening for chlamydia symptoms and other STIs is recommended
for all individuals who are sexually active.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individuals with multiple sex partners, change in sex partner, or engaging
in unprotected sex should consider regular screening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More frequent screening than annual might be indicated for certain individuals
on the basis of their risk behaviors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention of chlamydia:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sex partners of symptomatic male patients within the last 60 days from
symptom onset (or the most recent sex partner if the last contact was &gt;60
days) should be screened and treated for chlamydial infection epidemiologically.
The look-back period for contacts of female patients and asymptomatic males
is longer, e.g., 3 months.</p>
