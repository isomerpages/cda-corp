<summary><strong>What is Avian Influenza?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease
caused by influenza A viruses which primarily infects wild birds and poultry.
However, in rare cases, it may also infect humans and mammals. In particular,
the A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses have been known to cause majority of human
infections to date. Aside from A(H5N1), there have also been sporadic cases
of human infection with various subtypes of avian influenza (i.e. H3, H5,
H7, H9, H10).</p>
<p>Human infections with the avian influenza virus are rare but have occurred
sporadically since its first detection in Hong Kong in 1997. There has
been no sustained human-to-human transmission, although several small clusters
of infections have been reported.</p>
<p>The avian influenza viruses are divided into several sub-types. The most
frequently identified sub-types of avian influenza that have caused human
infections are the H5N1 and the H7N9 viruses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The A(H5N1) virus is highly contagious in birds and has been associated
with severe disease and deaths in humans. Since its widespread re-emergence
in 2003, the virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, and has become
endemic in poultry populations in some countries such as China and India.
Most human infections have occurred after prolonged and close contact with
infected poultry. Rare, limited and non-sustained person-to-person spread
of this virus had been reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) virus among dairy cattle herds was reported
across the United States (US) in March 2024. The A(H5N1) virus was also
detected in udder swabs and raw (unpasteurised) milk samples from infected
cows. Three human cases among farm workers in different farms were infected
after their exposure to the infected cows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human infections with H7N9 were first reported in China in 2013. Most
human infections had occurred after exposure to infected poultry or live
bird markets. Similarly, rare instances of limited, non-sustained person-to-person
spread have been reported in China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sporadic cases of human infections with other avian influenza viruses,
including H5N6 and H9N2 viruses, have also been reported in China and other
countries. Spread from birds to humans is rare and no person-to-person
spread has been reported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that sporadic human cases
of avian influenza infection are not unexpected, given that there is a
risk for sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases due to exposure
to infected poultry or contaminated environments, as long as Avian influenza
viruses are circulating in poultry.</p>

<summary><strong>How is Avian Influenza Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Human infection with avian influenza virus is primarily acquired through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Direct or close contact with potentially sick or dead birds and other
animals (e.g. mammals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct exposure to secretions or excretions from infected animals, or
their contaminated environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumption or exposure to infected animalsâ€™ undercooked or unprocessed
animal products (e.g. unpasteurized milk).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Slaughtering, de-feathering, handling or preparing infected birds for
consumption may increase the risks of contracting the avian influenza infection.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence to suggest that the virus can be spread
through the consumption of properly prepared poultry or eggs, although
a few cases have been linked to consumption of dishes containing raw, contaminated
poultry blood.</p>
<p>Based on current available evidence, avian influenza viruses have not
developed the capability to easily infect humans and other mammals, nor
to transmit easily between humans.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 1 to 10 days.</p>
