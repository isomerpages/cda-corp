<h2>What is Tuberculosis (TB)?</h2>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease caused by the bacteria <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.
It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of your
body, such as the brain, lymph nodes, the kidneys, bones, and joints. While
curable, TB remains a significant public health concern globally.</p>
<p>While curable, TB remains a significant public health concern globally.
In Singapore, TB is endemic and latent TB infection is not uncommon in
our population. Refer to <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-tuberculosis-situation-in-singapore-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOH’s website</a> for

<summary><strong>What are the Types of TB Conditions?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Active TB disease occurs when the body is unable to kill or contain the
bacteria, and the bacteria continues to grow. These individuals may have
symptoms and are infectious. They should visit a doctor immediately to
seek treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, not all individuals who are exposed to an infectious individual
will get active TB disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some develop latent TB infection (LTBI), where the body is able to stop
the bacteria from growing, rendering them inactive. These people do not
have any symptoms (e.g., cough) and cannot spread TB to others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 90% of healthy persons with LTBI, the TB bacteria remains inactive
throughout their life. However, the disease can be activated months or
even years later due to a weakened immune system, certain medical conditions
or other factors.</p>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is TB Disease Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is an airborne disease. TB disease spreads through the air when an
infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission usually requires close
and prolonged exposure to the TB bacteria.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TB disease cannot be spread by shaking someone’s hand, kissing, touching
bed linens, or sitting on toilet seats.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of TB Disease?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptoms of TB disease include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Persistent cough (lasting more than 3 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coughing blood or sputum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night sweats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chest pain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>TB disease is curable and its spread is preventable. Early detection and
prompt treatment is key. If you have symptoms, go see a doctor immediately.
Untreated TB can lead to severe lung damage, disability, or death.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Risk Factors?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The risk of developing TB disease is higher in those who have:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Weakened immune systems, due to drugs, sickness, or malnutrition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In prolonged (days to weeks) and close contact or living with someone
with TB disease, especially in crowded or poorly ventilated conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abusing substances (including smoking);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering certain medical conditions such as HIV, diabetes, or others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children under the age of 5 and the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Advice for High-risk Groups:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you have LTBI, you may be offered preventive treatment to reduce the
risk of developing active TB disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are at high risk for TB exposure, you should be vigilant about
symptoms and seek prompt medical evaluation if any concerns arise.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat Active TB Disease and Latent TB Infection?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Active TB disease is treated with a combination of TB medication, administered
for at least six to nine months. It is important for people with active
TB disease to complete the course of the treatment, even if they feel better
after the infectious period (first two weeks), as TB disease may recur
or become resistant to medication, which becomes extremely difficult to
treat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For maximum efficacy, these individuals take their medication under the
direct observation of a healthcare worker. This is called the Directly
Observed Therapy (DOT). This ensures that they take the correct dosage
and combination of medication, and are monitored to avoid treatment failure,
drug resistance, and further spread of TB. Should their condition worsen,
they may require hospitalisation or isolation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Persons with LTBI will be offered preventive treatment, if suitable. It
is important for these individuals to complete the course of their treatment
(about four to six months) to reduce the risk of developing active TB disease
in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Vaccine is available, it is only
effective in protecting babies from TB meningitis and widespread TB. It
offers limited protection against pulmonary (lung) TB, which is the most
common form among adults.</p>

<summary><strong>Someone I Am Close to Has TB Disease?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Those who have prolonged and close contact with someone who has active
TB disease may be contacted by the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP)
for TB screening.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Screening at the National Tuberculosis Care Centre (NTBCC) are scheduled
by appointment. You will receive a SMS with the date and time of the appointment.
You may call the centre to change the appointment date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Screening for TB may involve a QuantiFERON (TB) blood test and a chest
X-ray, if required. A repeat test may be scheduled by the centre. The results
will be out in two to three weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have a positive blood test result, further tests (i.e., chest X-ray)
are required to determine if it is latent TB infection or active TB disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your blood test result is negative, it means you are not infected with
TB bacteria.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TB screening is fully subsidised for registered contacts. Only those who
have been identified as close contacts of active TB cases are offered screening
under the National TB Programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is advisable for these individuals to go for screening to protect themselves
and their loved ones from getting active TB disease.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: Do Identified Contacts Need to be Isolated?</strong>
</p>
<p>Identified contacts do not need to be isolated. They can proceed with
their daily work unless they are tested positive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: When is it Safe for the Person Diagnosed with Active TB Disease to Return to Office?</strong>
</p>
<p>They will be considered non-infectious after two weeks of treatment. Then,
