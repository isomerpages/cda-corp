<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP)&nbsp;on AMR was launched
in 2017.</p>
<p>This is aligned with these global objectives in the WHO Global Action
Plan on AMR that includes improving AMR awareness, optimising the use of
antimicrobials, strengthening surveillance and research, and reducing infections.</p>

</p>
<p>A 'One Health' approach in combating AMR through cross-sectoral collaboration
is essential. The NSAP brings together the Ministry of Health (MOH), Health
Promotion Board (HPB), National Parks Board (NParks), National Environment
Agency (NEA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and PUB, Singapore's National
Water Agency, to coordinate and drive AMR efforts across the human, environmental,
food and animal sectors through a multi-agency national work group.</p>
<p>The NSAP aims to reduce the emergence and prevent the spread of drug-resistant
organisms through five core strategies:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raising awareness and understanding of AMR and appropriate antimicrobial
use through Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the levels, distribution and trends of resistant organisms
and antimicrobial use through regular Surveillance and Risk Assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filling in gaps in knowledge and improving our understanding of the AMR
situation through Research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the spread of drug-resistant organisms through effective Prevention
and Control of Infections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing inappropriate use and preserving the effectiveness of medicines
through the Optimisation of Antimicrobial Use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
