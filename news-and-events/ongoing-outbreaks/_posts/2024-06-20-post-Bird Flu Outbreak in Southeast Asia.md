<p>As of June 20, 2024, Southeast Asia faces a wave of highly pathogenic
H5N1 avian influenza. Cambodia reported the most concerning cases, with
six human infections linked to the virus, one of which resulted in death.
This outbreak involved a reassortant strain of H5N1, raising concerns due
to its potential for adaptation.</p>
<p>While there haven't been recent reports of large-scale outbreaks in the
region, public health officials remain vigilant. Continued surveillance
in poultry farms and awareness campaigns for those working with birds are
crucial to prevent further spread and potential human infections.</p>
