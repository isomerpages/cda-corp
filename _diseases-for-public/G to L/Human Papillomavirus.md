<p>HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus, a common virus that can infect many
parts of the body in both males and females.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 different types of HPV, grouped into high-risk
types (may cause cancer) and low-risk types (non-cancer causing).</p>

<p>Sometimes, the HPV infection can persist and cause abnormal changes to
the cells which may develop into cervical cancer. This usually takes years
but is one of the most significant impacts of HPV infection.</p>

<p>Most HPV infections do not have any symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some HPV infections may cause mouth, throat, or genital warts, or even
throat cancer.</p>
<p>For women, high-risk HPV infection on the cervix can cause cervical cancer.
It typically does not have any symptoms. To detect the cancer, cervical
screening or HPV DNA tests are done.</p>
<p>Symptoms of cervical cancer include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Abnormal vaginal bleeding such as bleeding after menstrual periods or
after sex; or</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat HPV?</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Treatment is typically directed at HPV-associated conditions such as precancerous
lesions, cancer, or genital warts. This is because there are no treatments
that completely eliminate HPV.</p>
<p>While HPV cannot be treated, regular cervical cancer screening can identify
high-risk HPV cancer-causing types or abnormalities through a pap smear.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent HPV?</strong>
</summary>

<p>Get vaccinated. Females aged nine to 26 are strongly advised to get the
HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer. This vaccine protects against
70%â€“90% of high-risk HPV types.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To supplement vaccination, regular cervical cancer screening is recommended
for women aged 25 onwards.</p>
