<summary><strong>What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>AMR&nbsp;occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi,
and some parasites develop resistance against antimicrobial agents such
as antibiotics. Infections from these microorganisms may persist and spread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared AMR to be one of the
top 10 global public health threats. Tackling AMR requires a collective
effort from everyone, including the public, healthcare professionals, and
the authorities.</p>

<summary><strong>Why is AMR a Concern?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>With the development of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents,
many medicines are increasingly losing their ability to treat infections.
This threatens to reverse the benefits from the advancements in science
and medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WHO warns that drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deaths globally
each year by 2050, highlighting the projected economic strain from prolonged
hospitalisation stays and increased morbidity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were 4.95 million global deaths associated with bacterial AMR in
2019, according to a 2022 study published in <em>The Lancet</em>. AMR can
affect anyone at any stage of life and is evolving at rates that outpace
developments of new antimicrobial agents. AMR developed in one region has
the potential to spread through increased through trade and travel.</p>

<summary><strong>How Can Healthcare Professionals Play Their Part?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Judicious prescribing of antimicrobials plays a key role in minimising
the risk of misuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ensure the 4 Rights when prescribing, dispensing or administering antimicrobials
to patients:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antimicrobial Agent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should prioritise educating their patients on
appropriate antimicrobial use, getting recommended vaccines, and maintaining
good hygiene habits to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Appropriate infection prevention and control measures will further reduce
the risk of the spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should also keep abreast with the latest developments,
knowledge, and resistance patterns in their healthcare institutions and
communities to improve antimicrobial use in clinical practice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, actions such as supporting institutional and national AMR surveillance
programmes or reporting AMR outbreaks promptly to authorities are essential
to control the spread of AMR.</p>
