<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Mpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the
genus Orthopoxvirus. Two clades exist: Clade I and Clade II.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox was historically known to be endemic in Central and Western Africa.
However, a global outbreak was first identified in May 2022, where cases
were reported in several locations that had not experienced with mpox.
Most cases were primarily driven by human-to-human close (including sexual)
contact. Globally, the number of mpox cases peaked in August 2022 and has
been on a downward trend. According to US Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention’s (US CDC) 2022–2023 Mpox data, a cumulative total of 93,500
laboratory-confirmed mpox cases has been reported.</p>
<p>As of December 2023, there were a total of 29 confirmed mpox cases reported
in Singapore (excluding an isolated case of mpox diagnosed in 2022).</p>
<p>On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing
outbreak of mpox to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC).</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox virus (Clade I; Clade II)</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Spread of mpox may occur when a person comes into close contact with an
infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir
for transmission to humans) in areas where there are animal reservoirs
(i.e. West and Central Africa), or more commonly, another infected human
(which was the most common mode in the 2022 outbreak), or materials contaminated
with the virus. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if
breaks are not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes
(eyes, nose, or mouth or anogenital mucosa).</p>
<p>Outside West and Central Africa, the outbreak of mpox had primarily affected
men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Up to 21 days (usually 6–16
days).</p>
<p>Infectious period: From onset of symptoms, until after all the scabs on
the skin have fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed underneath.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 'classic' mpox, more than 70% of infected persons are symptomatic,
and early symptoms of mpox include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle ache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backache;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lymphadenopathy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asthenia, or a general feeling of exhaustion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within one to three days after the onset of fever, infected persons will
develop a maculopapular rash, often starting from the face before becoming
generalised (centrifugal distribution), including involvement of palms
and soles in up to 75% of cases. The lesions progress to become vesicles
and then pustules, before crusting occurs in approximately 10 days, which
then spontaneously fall off. The disease is typically self-limiting, with
symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14 to 21 days. However,
the infection can be fatal, particularly in young children, with a reported
mortality rate of 1% to 10% during outbreaks.</p>
<p>In the 2022 outbreak, presentation had often been more atypical and variable
in terms of order of onset of fever versus rash, and extent of dissemination
of rash. The disease caused by mpox in the global 2022 outbreak had been
milder than in ‘classic’ mpox as the virus subtype (known as ‘clade’) is
different. &nbsp;About 72% of cases reported prodromal systemic symptoms
(e.g. fever, fatigue, muscle aches). Anal and genital lesions were commonly
reported, and lesions may initially appear quite non-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Atypical features include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Only a few or even just a single lesion, lesions which begin in the genital
or perineal/perianal area and do not spread further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lesions appearing at different (asynchronous) stages of development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance of lesions before the onset of fever, malaise, and other constitutional
symptoms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptomatology may masquerade as other sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), and mpox may occur concurrently with other STIs. Patients remain
infectious from the onset of fever until the vesicles/lesions have scabbed
over and have separated, with normal skin underneath (re-epithelialisation).</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contact with infected animals, preparation, or consumption of bush meat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close contact with confirmed cases, including history of sexual or intimate
in-person contact with persons in a social or sexual network experiencing
mpox activity; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The diagnosis of mpox can be confirmed by testing by PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) which is a type of molecular test performed at the National Public
Health Laboratory (NPHL). When a case is suspected, clinicians should contact
the NPHL via their hospital's diagnostic laboratories, and send swabs from
vesicles (throat swabs and blood are less preferred alternative due to
lower sensitivity) in a dry and sterile tube (without universal transport
medium) for further diagnostic testing.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox is typically a self-limiting illness and most mpox patients usually
recover within two to four weeks, although serious illness and complications
may occur especially in vulnerable persons (e.g. young children, pregnant
women, or immunocompromised individuals). Usually, no specific antiviral
treatment is required for majority of cases, and clinical management is
supportive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspect and confirmed mpox cases should be isolated, preferably in a negative
pressure isolation (NEP) room, if admitted. Healthcare workers caring for
these cases should practice strict hand hygiene and don personal protective
equipment including disposable gowns, gloves, N95 masks or equivalent,
as well as eye protection.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Individuals are strongly advised to maintain vigilance and take the following
precautions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Monitor their health and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene,
including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands
are soiled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid contact with persons who are unwell and objects that may have become
contaminated with infectious fluids such as soiled clothing, bedding, or
towels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sex partners
or casual sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When travelling, avoid contact with wild animals that could harbour the
virus, and consumption of bush meat; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek medical attention immediately if you develop symptoms such as sudden
onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash, and inform your doctor
of any recent travel or exposure history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vaccination:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The MVA-BN (JYNNEOS),&nbsp;a&nbsp;third-generation smallpox vaccine, is
currently available as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for&nbsp;persons
who have been identified to be close contacts of confirmed mpox cases,
as well as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for persons at higher risk of&nbsp;being
infected with mpox based on epidemiological factors in the 2022 outbreak.
While JYNNEOS is estimated to provide over 80% protection against mpox,
current data remains limited in concluding the level and duration of protection
conferred by vaccination, and persons are advised to continue adhering
to the recommended precautions against the disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aligning with international recommendations, population-wide vaccination
is currently not recommended as a preventive strategy for mpox, as the
risk to the public remains low, as disease transmission is predominantly
via close physical or prolonged contact.</p>
