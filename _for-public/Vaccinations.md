<h2><strong>Building Immunity Through Vaccinations</strong></h2>
<p>Vaccinations protect you and your loved ones from illnesses like influenza
and pneumococcal disease. Get vaccinated – it's the best defense against
serious complications preventable diseases can cause.</p>
<h3>Why Vaccinate?</h3>
<p><strong>Germs are everywhere</strong>
</p>
<p>We live in a world where you can find germs almost everywhere. And even
though you may not realise it, your body is in a never-ending battle fighting
these germs as and when it is exposed to them.</p>
<p>The part of your body responsible for this is your immune system – and
it is strengthened when you get vaccinated.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Vaccines Train Your Body</strong>
</p>
<p>When you get vaccinated, you teach your body how to fight diseases. Think
of it like a training session. Your body learns to recognise and handle
these germs as if you have caught the disease. So, if and when you are
actually exposed to the germs in the future, your immune system will remember
how to fight it.</p>
<p>If you are infected before you get vaccinated, you are at risk of falling
seriously ill. The infection can lead to complications, disabilities and
even death.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthen Your Immunity with Vaccination</strong>
</p>
<p>If you generally lead a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly and
eating healthily, and hardly fall sick, you may have a good immune system.
However, it may not be enough to ensure that you can fight an infectious
disease. Vaccinations help build your immune system by strengthening it
against serious infectious diseases.</p>
