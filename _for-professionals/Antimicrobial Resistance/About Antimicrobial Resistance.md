<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) to be one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity.
Tackling AMR requires a collective effort from everyone, from the general
public to healthcare professionals as well as the authorities.</p>
<h3>What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?</h3>
<p>AMR occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and some
parasites develop mechanisms to resist being killed by antimicrobial agents
such as antibiotics. Infections thus persist and may spread to others.</p>

<summary><strong>Why is AMR a Concern?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>AMR presents a major threat to global health. With the gradual and increasing
development of resistance to antimicrobial agents, many medicines are increasingly
losing their ability to treat infections. This threatens to reverse the
benefits derived from years of advancements in science and medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WHO warns that drug-resistant diseases could lead to a projected 10 million
deaths globally each year by 2050 2 and highlights the projected economic
strain from the impact of dealing with prolonged hospitalisation stays
and increased morbidity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A study published in the Lancet in 2022 estimated that in 2019, 4.95 million
global deaths were associated with bacterial AMR3. AMR can affect anyone,
at any stage of life and it is evolving at a rate that outpaces the development
of new antimicrobial agents. With increased global connectivity through
trade and travel, AMR developed in one region has the potential to spread
to another around the globe.</p>

<summary><strong>How Can Healthcare Professionals Play Their Part?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Judicious prescribing of antimicrobials plays a key role in minimising
the risk of misuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ensure the 4 Rights when prescribing, dispensing or administering antimicrobials
to patients:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antimicrobial Agent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should prioritise educating their patients on
the importance of appropriate antimicrobial use, to receive recommended
vaccines and maintain good hygiene habits to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Appropriate infection prevention and control measures will further reduce
the risk of the spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should also stay equipped with updated knowledge
and keep abreast of resistance patterns in their respective institutions
and community to improve antimicrobial use in clinical practice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, supporting institutional and national AMR surveillance programmes
and prompt reporting of any AMR outbreaks to the appropriate authority
are actions essential to control the spread of AMR.</p>
