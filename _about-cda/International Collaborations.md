<p>The Kirby Institute and the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) re have
signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding that formalises the collaborative
synergies and opportunities between the two organisations.</p>
<p>The agreement sets out the intention to collaborate on infectious disease
research across a range of research disciplines, including immunovirology
pathogenesis, surveillance activities, and biomedical interventions including
therapeutic studies.</p>
<p>The two organisations are leaders in their respective countries, and share
a common goal of understanding and minimising the impacts of bloodborne
viruses, antimicrobial resistance and respiratory pathogens, including
a major focus on COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness in each country and
our region more broadly.</p>
<p>“As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, infectious disease control is
best achieved through partnership and cooperation,” says Kirby Institute
Director, Scientia Professor Anthony Kelleher. “We are thrilled to formally
take forward this vision with our colleagues at the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. Through this Memorandum of Understanding, I am hopeful
that we can join forces to foster innovation, collaboration, and enhance
infectious disease research within our countries and across our region.”</p>
<p>Executive Director of the CDA, Professor Vernon Lee says, “We are proud
to partner a world-renowned institution like the Kirby Institute in strengthening
our capabilities in infectious disease research and implementation science
in topics such as respiratory infections, antimicrobial resistance and
HIV. We are also looking forward to exchanging knowledge and information
on disease control programmes through this partnership.”</p>
