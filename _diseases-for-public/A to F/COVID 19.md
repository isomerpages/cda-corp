</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in late
2019 and quickly spread across the world. It was declared a global pandemic
on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In May 2023, WHO
declared that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency of international
concern. However, the virus continues to circulate in communities and remains
a global health risk.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is COVID-19 Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>COVID-19 spreads mainly through the respiratory droplets or particles
released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. Other
people can breathe in these droplets and particles, or these droplets and
particles can land on others’ eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
<p>The virus can also be spread indirectly when a person touches a contaminated
surface (e.g. doorknob, utensils) then touches his or her eyes, nose or
mouth.</p>
<p>The incubation period of COVID-19 is about 1 to 14 days and can vary across
variants.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Potential Complications of COVID-19?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>COVID-19 can potentially lead to complications such as shortness of breath
due to pneumonia and respiratory failure, as well as other severe conditions,
potentially leading to death.</p>
<p>The groups most likely to develop severe disease are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>persons aged 60 years or older;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pregnant women;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>persons who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions
such as obesity, diabetes, heart, lung or renal disease.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some individuals may experience long-term effects from COVID-19 infection,
known as “long COVID-19”, where symptoms last for weeks or months. This
condition can affect people of all ages, including those who initially
had mild symptoms. Symptoms and condition can range from mild to severe
and may relapse over time. Most common symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness,

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>General advice for prevention of COVID-19</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<p>avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Vaccination</strong>
</p>
<p>Vaccination remains our first line of defence against COVID-19 infection.
Our high vaccination rates has been pivotal in enabling us to weather past
waves of COVID-19 infections, build up our societal resilience, and protect
our healthcare system.</p>
<p>The following vaccines are available under the National Vaccination Programme
(NVP):</p>
