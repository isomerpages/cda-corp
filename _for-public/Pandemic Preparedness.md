<summary><strong>What are Pandemics?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A pandemic is a disease outbreak that occurs over a large geographical
area and across international borders and affects a significantly large
proportion of the world’s population.</p>
<p>Pandemics impact public health, as well as social and economic activities.
For example, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many sectors including the
education, finance, hospitality, and real estate sectors with pandemic
control measures such as border closures, movement restrictions, quarantine,
and isolation.</p>

<summary><strong>What is the Threat of Pandemics to Singapore?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If a disease outbreak epidemic is not contained, limited, or slowed within
a geographical region like a country or continent, it may evolve into a
pandemic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Urbanisation and climate change can significantly influence how fast a
disease spreads. Urbanisation could disrupt habitats and increase interactions
between humans and animals, which also increases the risk of transmitting
animal-to-human diseases. Concurrently, climate change could disrupt ecological
balance and make conditions more conducive for diseases to spread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, Singapore is an international travel hub with a high population
density. This makes it vulnerable to the importation and transmission of
new infectious diseases and reemergence of endemic ones.</p>

<summary><strong>Why is Pandemic Preparedness Important?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Being prepared for a pandemic is important as it helps reduce the spread
of infectious diseases, illnesses, and deaths; minimise impacts on our
healthcare systems; and mitigate social and economic disruptions caused
by disease outbreaks. Enhancing pandemic preparedness, prevention, and
response is an ongoing effort and remains a crucial national priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future pandemics may be different from what we have experienced. For example,
COVID-19 strategies and measures were different from SARS and MERS. Therefore,
pandemic preparedness and response needs an agile and modular approach
to cover both known and unknown disease threats using a combination of
policy, public health, medical, and social measures to manage disease outbreaks.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Why is System Resilience Important?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>System resilience is crucial for pandemic preparedness as it ensures health
infrastructures, supply chains, and essential services can withstand and
adapt to disruptions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A resilient system can quickly respond to, mitigate, and recover swiftly
from disease outbreaks. This adaptability safeguards public health, maintains
social and economic stability, and reduces a pandemic’s strain on society.</p>
