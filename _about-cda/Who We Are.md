<p>The <strong>Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) </strong>was established
in 2025 as a statutory board under Singapore's Ministry of Health <strong>(MOH) </strong>to
serve as the central authority for public health policymaking to manage
and control the threat of communicable diseases. This is aimed at strengthening
Singapore's public health capabilities built during the COVID-19 response
to ensure a unified command and coordinated approach across all situations,
from routine disease control to future outbreaks.</p>
<p>CDA safeguards the nation from communicable diseases through disease surveillance,
outbreak investigations, vaccination programs, public education, and global
health collaboration. Beyond domestic activities, the CDA aims to expand
Singaporeâ€™s global outreach and foster collaboration with international
partners.</p>
