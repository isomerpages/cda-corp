<summary><strong>Screening initiation for TB clusters detected at congregate settings</strong>

<p>In 2021, two separate clusters of TB involving 18 people who visited the
Bedok Singapore Pools betting outlet were identified. No common links were
found between them other than that they all frequented the Bedok centre
over periods ranging from months to years and spent prolonged stretches
there. As a precaution, patrons who visited the betting centre between
12 Feb 2020 and 25 Mar 2020 were contacted for screening. Voluntary screening
was also offered to patrons who spent prolonged period of cumulative days
at the betting centre between 2018 and 25 Mar 2020.</p>

<p>In 2016, a pre-school in Bukit Batok screened children and staff for TB
after a teacher was diagnosed with the disease. The centre had 104 pre-school
children aged between two months and six. Screening was conducted on two
separate days. 80 children who were younger and more vulnerable were screened
on the first day, while the rest were screened on another day. The centreâ€™s
staff were also screened.</p>

<p>In 2022, a TB cluster involving seven people staying at Block 2, Jalan
Bukit Merah was identified. Genetic analysis revealed that all seven cases
had similar genetic make-up, suggesting that they were linked by spread
from one or more common sources. Investigations into the cases did not
reveal any common links, other than they lived in the same block. Mandatory
screening for residents of the block was carried out, following an earlier
voluntary screening where about 170 people were tested positive for TB.</p>

<p>In 2016, a cluster of six multi-drug resistant TB (MDRTB) cases were detected
in a block in Ang Mo Kio. Other than the three patients living in the same
unit, the rest did not know or did not interact with one another. Residents
of the block were offered voluntary screening.</p>

<p>In 2020, a TB cluster involving four people was detected at a HDB block
in Hougang. The four cases had similar genetic make-up and investigations
into the cases did not reveal any common links, other than they lived in
the same blocks. Current and former residents of the block were offered
voluntary screening.</p>
