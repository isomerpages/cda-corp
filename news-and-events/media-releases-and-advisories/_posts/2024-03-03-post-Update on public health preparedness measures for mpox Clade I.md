<p>As part of a whole-of-government effort, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has coordinated public health preparedness measures to respond to a mpox
Clade I epidemic, based on what we know about the virus and disease so
far. We are monitoring the situation closely with our international counterparts,
and are ready to respond decisively should the situation change.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Response Measures</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Borders</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. While there are no direct flights between Singapore and any mpox outbreak
country thus far, MOH, together with the Ministry of Transport and the
Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, have put in place temperature and
visual screening at Changi and Seletar airports for inbound travellers
and crew arriving on flights from places where they may have been exposed
to mpox Clade I outbreaks. Similar screening measures have also been implemented
at sea checkpoints for crew and passengers arriving on ships from mpox-affected
areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Health advisories have been put in place at air checkpoints, so that
travellers can take the necessary personal precautions to avoid being infected.
Travellers are strongly advised to adhere to the advisory, especially if
they are travelling to and from affected countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. All travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms (e.g. fever
or rash) and travel history through the SG Arrival Card. Travellers who
have fever, rash and/or symptoms compatible with mpox will be assessed
by doctors at the borders, and subsequently referred to hospitals for further
assessment and testing, if necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Detection, Tracing and Isolation</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. MOH has notified all medical practitioners and healthcare institutions
to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases to MOH immediately,
including and especially suspected Clade I infections. Suspect cases will
be transferred to hospitals for further assessment and treatment, if necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Upon confirmation of a Clade I case, MOH will immediately initiate
contact tracing. Close contacts of the case will be quarantined in a designated
government quarantine facility. The quarantine period is currently set
at 21 days, which is the incubation period observed in Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Testing and Treatment</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. All suspect Clade I cases identified by primary care providers will
be conveyed to designated hospitals for further assessment and testing.
Testing for mpox is conducted at the National Public Health Laboratory
through polymerase chain reaction tests on swabs of skin lesions. To date,
there have yet to be point-of-care rapid test kits that are sufficiently
accurate in diagnosing mpox.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Adult cases will be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious
Diseases (NCID) while paediatric cases will be conveyed to KK Women’s and
Children’s Hospital. Adult-child family dyads will be conveyed to the National
University Hospital. Cases will be isolated while pending test results.
All cases who test positive for Clade I will continue to be isolated in
healthcare facilities until they are no longer infectious, to prevent further
exposure to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. The treatment of mpox cases is mainly through supportive care to help
manage symptoms and prevent complications. While there are currently no
specific therapeutics approved for the treatment of mpox infection, antivirals
such as Tecovirimat will be prescribed for treatment of mpox cases with
severe disease. This is aligned with the practices of other public health
agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. MOH will continue to monitor new developments and assess the safety,
efficacy, and suitability of emerging mpox therapeutics in meeting the
needs of our population.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Other Community Measures</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Based on current evidence that mpox is spread mainly through close
physical contact, such as within households, we do not recommend wearing
a mask for people who are well. However, should there be evidence of significant
respiratory transmission, such as outside of households and in public areas,
MOH will consider implementing masking on public transport, and in crowded
indoor places.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. In preschools and schools (including special education schools), existing
measures and protocols for other infectious diseases, such as hand, foot
and mouth disease, remain relevant. These include maintaining good hygiene
practices, conducting visual screenings for symptoms for students, as well
as outbreak management measures such as isolation, contact tracing, decontamination
of premises, and temporary closure of specific classes or schools to contain
disease spread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13. Together with the Ministry of Manpower and National Environment Agency,
we are conducting wastewater testing at migrant worker dormitories and
the Onboard Centre. Temperature screening and visual screening have also
been put in place for newly arrived work permit holders at the Onboard
Centre. In the event of any mpox cases being detected, there are protocols
in place for isolation, transport of suspect cases to hospitals for testing
and assessment, and containment measures to support workers in their recovery
and prevent any further spread within the dormitories.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>14. The mpox Clade I virus appears to be less transmissible compared to
respiratory viruses such as Influenza or COVID-19.&nbsp; Hence, based on
current understanding of the disease epidemiology of mpox Clade I, and
the fact that contact tracing and quarantine will further suppress transmission,
population-wide mpox vaccination is not recommended for now. There is also
no vaccination recommendation for travellers to mpox-affected countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>15. In addition, there is good evidence indicating that smallpox vaccination
renders cross-protection against mpox. Since smallpox vaccination was required
in Singapore until early 1981, there will be some mpox immunity among a
significant segment of the Singapore population, i.e. those who are 45
years old and above.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>16. JYNNEOS, a live attenuated (non-replicating) vaccine, has been approved
for use in Singapore for protection against mpox and smallpox. We will
administer this selectively, to two groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>17. First, for healthcare workers who are at the highest risk of exposure
to mpox.&nbsp; Personal protective equipment and infection control protocols
remain the key mode of prevention. However, to further protect this group,
such as those working in the NCID who need to render direct care and will
be in very close contact with mpox Clade I cases, JYNNEOS will be offered
as a pre-exposure prophylaxis to provide additional protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>18. Second, for close contacts of confirmed mpox cases, the Expert Committee
on Immunisation has recommended a single dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine to
be offered and administered within 14 days of exposure to reduce their
risk of the disease. This will be administered while they are in quarantine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>19. Our current supply of JYNNEOS is projected to be sufficient based
on the current vaccination strategy. We will continue to monitor the situation
and adjust our vaccination strategy accordingly, as the mpox situation
and vaccine supplies evolve globally.</p>
<p><strong>About mpox</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>20. Mpox, caused by the monkeypox virus, has two subtypes, namely Clade
I and Clade II. Clade II has been circulating globally as part of the 2022
multi-country outbreak. Since 2023, there has been an increase in the number
of mpox Clade I cases reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC). From July 2024, at least five<sup>1</sup> other countries in the
region, including those where historically mpox Clade I was not endemic,
have also reported mpox cases and outbreaks. Thus far, the outbreak remains
generally confined to Africa, with two cases of the more severe mpox Clade
I reported in Sweden and Thailand. There are currently no reports of local
spread in these two countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>21. The main symptom of mpox is rash. Other symptoms include fever, muscle
aches, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. The incubation period is typically
between six and 16 days, and can be up to 21 days. Individuals are usually
infectious from the time symptoms begin until all scabs have fallen off
naturally. Mpox Clade I, which has a recorded case fatality rate of about
3% to 4% in the DRC, has been known to cause more severe disease than Clade
II, but clinical outcomes may be different in countries outside of Africa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>22. Based on current evidence, mpox can be spread through close contact
with respiratory tract secretions, skin lesions and bodily fluids of an
infected person or animal, as well as recently contaminated objects or
surfaces. In adults, mpox is transmitted primarily through close physical
contact, including sexual contact, with infected individuals. In children,
it is mainly spread through physical contact in households, playtime and
exposure to wild game. More data is needed to determine the risk mpox poses
to children, and MOH is monitoring this closely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>23. Compared to COVID-19, mpox is less infectious. Every person infected
with mpox spreads the disease to an average of 1.3 other persons. Comparatively,
without measures, each case of COVID-19 and its subsequent variants spreads
to an average of two to five persons.&nbsp;</p>
