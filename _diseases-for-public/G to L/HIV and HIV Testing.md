<summary><strong>What is HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that weakens your body’s
immune system by destroying CD4 (T-cell) lymphocytes. It is spread through
bodily fluids like breast milk, blood, semen, or vaginal discharge from
a person living with HIV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people contract HIV through unprotected sex, sharing or using unsanitised
drug equipment like needles, or not taking medication to prevent or treat
HIV. If untreated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>What is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced stage of HIV
infection, causing your immune system to be severely weakened. You receive
an AIDS diagnosis when:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of your CD4
cell count.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, a healthy CD4 cell count is above 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV infection progresses through four different stages:</p>
<p><strong><u>Seroconversion Illness/Acute Retroviral Syndrome&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This stage is characterised by flu-like symptoms like fever, swelling
of the lymph nodes, rash, sore throat, muscle pain, diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting, headache, weight loss, or oral thrush. Some individuals may have
oral and genital ulcerations and neurological illnesses like aseptic meningitis.
The symptoms usually resolve on their own in most patients. The median
duration is 20 days, but it could range from less than a week to three
months.</p>
<p><strong><u>Asymptomatic (“Latent”) Disease</u></strong>
</p>
<p>There are no specific symptoms or signs in this stage, but the virus is
actively replicating and destroying the immune system by reducing CD4 cell
count. Swollen lymph nodes, which are often not noticed by the patient,
are usually present.</p>
<p><strong><u>Symptomatic Disease</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This stage presents more obvious symptoms such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fever;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swollen lymph nodes;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin and oral conditions (such as oral thrush, hairy leukoplakia, herpes
zoster, recurrent herpes simplex); and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunological conditions (such as having . idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura, multiple drug allergies).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>AIDS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The last stage of infection is characterised by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your CD4 cell count falling below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing one or more opportunistic infections regardless of your CD4
cell count.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunistic infections include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Viral: Persistent HSV ulceration for more than 1 month; CMV retinitis
or diseases involving body parts other than the liver, spleen, or lymph
nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bacterial: Tuberculosis (especially extrapulmonary); atypical mycobacteria
infections; recurrent bacterial pneumonia (2 or more episodes in 1 year);
recurrent non-typhoid-salmonella septicaemia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fungi: Oesophageal candidiasis; cryptococcal meningitis; histoplasmosis

<summary><strong>How to Test for HIV?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Getting tested for HIV is the only way to know your status. Delaying detection
and diagnosis could lead to poorer prognosis and treatment outcomes, increasing
the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>In Singapore, HIV testing is typically performed in hospitals, clinics,
and community-based organisations. Some clinics provide anonymous or rapid
testing services, where the latter can provide results in 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use HIV self-test kits. They can be purchased under the HIV
self-testing pilot programme at the Department of Sexually Transmitted
Infections Control (DSC) Clinic and Action for AIDS (AfA) Anonymous Test
Site (ATS).&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Understanding HIV Test Results</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>You Tested Negative for HIV. What’s Next?</p>
<p>A negative result means there were no signs of a HIV infection in your
sample. However, you might still be infected because HIV takes about one
to six weeks to incubate. The time between potential exposure and testing
is called the window period.</p>
<p>Different HIV tests have different window periods. Ask your healthcare
provider about the window period for the HIV test you are taking. For HIV
self-test kits, you can find the information &nbsp;in the package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a negative HIV test result and the last possible HIV exposure
was:</p>
<table style="minWidth: 50px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Less than 72 hours ago</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>You may need post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (see PEP below under ‘HIV
Prevention and Treatment’).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Less than 90 days ago</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>You will need to repeat the HIV test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you get a negative test result again after the window period, and have
no possible HIV exposure during that time, then you do not have HIV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You Tested HIV Positive, What’s Next?</p>
<p>All positive test results require a follow-up test for confirmation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you test positive:</p>
<table style="minWidth: 50px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you get a positive test result again, it means you have HIV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do When Diagnosed with HIV?</p>
<p>There is currently no effective cure for HIV, but it can be controlled
with proper care. This can be done through antiretroviral therapy (ART).
With early detection and treatment, people living with HIV can live long,
healthy lives, and protect their partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIV treatment is available in most public hospitals like the <a href="https://www.ncid.sg/Facilities-Services/Services/Pages/Clinical-HIV-Programme.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID)</a>,
<a href="https://www.nuh.com.sg/care-at-nuh/specialties/medicine/infectious-diseases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National University Hospital (NUH)</a>, Singapore General Hospital (SGH),
and Changi General Hospital (CGH); and private healthcare institutions
in Singapore. Most HIV medications are <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/subsidised-drug-list" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">subsidised</a>,
making them accessible and affordable.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>How to Prevent Getting HIV?</p>
<p>Staying HIV negative means:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Practising the ABCD approach to prevent HIV (Abstinence from casual sex,
Be faithful, Correct and consistent condom usage, and early Detection);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment if there
is ongoing risk (see PrEP below under ‘HIV Prevention and Treatment’);
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing regularly for HIV, or every 3–6 months if you engage in risky
behaviours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Treatment?</p>
<p>Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a risk-reduction treatment against
HIV. When taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV
infection. PrEP only protects against HIV, so condom use is still important
to prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find out if PrEP is suitable for you <a href="https://form.gov.sg/633d18823c24b6001161899a" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are interested in PrEP.</p>
<p>What is Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Treatment?</p>
<p>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a short course of HIV medicine to prevent
its transmission. It must be used within 72 hours of possible high-risk
exposure and should only be used during emergencies. High-risk exposure
to HIV includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Any unprotected anal or vaginal sex with someone who is HIV positive or
belongs to a HIV-risk group (commercial sex workers, IV drug users, men
who have sex with men, or bisexual men);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing or exposure to contaminated needles or blades, particularly needle-stick
injuries; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victims of sexual assault.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PEP is not meant for regular use, and it is not a substitute for other
HIV prevention methods such as consistent condom use. You should consider
PrEP instead if you are repeatedly exposed to HIV.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you think you need PEP. Should you require PEP
during emergencies, please visit the Emergency Department of any public
hospital and request for it.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>What is Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)?</p>
<p>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is recommended for all individuals living
with HIV. Although ART cannot cure HIV, it can control the virus and help
them live longer, healthier lives. ART can also reduce the risk of HIV
transmission, but it does not prevent transmission of other STIs.</p>
<p>What is Treatment as Prevention (TasP)?</p>
<p>Treatment as Prevention (TasP) refers to the use of HIV medicine to decrease
the risk of HIV transmission. People living with HIV who take the medicine
as prescribed can suppress their HIV viral load to an undetectable level
(less than 50 copies/ml), reducing the risk of HIV transmission to others
(i.e. Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).</p>
