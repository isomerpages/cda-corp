<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.
It primarily affects the lungs, although it can also spread to other parts
of the body. While treatable and curable, TB remains a significant public
health concern globally.</p>

<p><strong><u>Global</u></strong>
</p>
<p>TB is the second leading infectious killer worldwide, after COVID-19,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with TB, with 1.3 million
deaths. About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been
infected with TB bacteria (also known as latent TB infection), though not
everyone develops the active TB disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Local</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2023, there were 1,201 new cases of active TB disease among Singapore
residents. This is lower than the 1,251 cases in 2022. The incidence rate
was 28.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2023, compared to 30.4 cases per
100,000 in 2022.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TB is endemic in Singapore, and latent TB infection is not uncommon in
our population.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is an air-borne disease and is transmitted through close and prolonged

TB disease. Not all individuals who are exposed to an infectious individual
will get TB.</p>

<p><strong>Incubation period</strong>: 2 - 8 weeks, but can be much longer
(years)</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Individuals with active TB disease
are infectious until they have completed effective treatment.</p>

<h3>About the National Tuberculosis Programme</h3>
<p>The National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP) is a national TB prevention
and care programme aimed at protecting the people of Singapore from the
disease. It was launched by the Ministry of Health in 1997 to further its
vision of a TB-free Singapore with people-centred care.</p>
<p>NTBP is led by the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA), which uses a multi-pronged
approach to control TB. This approach includes&nbsp; prompt diagnosis and
management of the disease; effective contact tracing and screening; community
engagement to raise public awareness; strengthening partnerships, and implementing
sustainable strategies.</p>
