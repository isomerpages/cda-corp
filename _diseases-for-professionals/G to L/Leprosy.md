<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease.
The disease affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of
the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Leprosy is known to occur at
all ages ranging from early childhood to old age. Leprosy is curable and
treatment during early stages can prevent disability.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Worldwide incidence of leprosy appears to be declining. This is due to
improvements in socioeconomic conditions and access to effective treatment.
Humans and armadillos are the only known reservoirs. Susceptibility is
genetically determined with more than 90% of the population naturally immune.
Leprosy incidence rates in Singapore have declined significantly.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The exact mode of transmission not clearly established; household and
prolonged close contact appears to be important. Transmission is believed
to be from respiratory secretions, and less effectively, direct skin-to-skin
contact.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> A few weeks to 30 years (average 3-10
years)</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Patients can be considered non-infectious
shortly after therapy is started</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The disease mainly affects the skin and the peripheral nerves. Most patients
present with asymptomatic skin lesions while some (&lt;5%) present with
nerve deficits without skin signs. The affected skin may be pale or red,
and it may be a plaque, nodule or tumour. Loss of pin prick sensation within
skin lesions is pathognomonic of leprosy. Peripheral nerve involvement
may cause muscle weakness and paralysis of limbs. Examination may reveal
enlarged nerves with or without functional deficit.</p>
<p>For the purposes of treatment, leprosy is classified into 2 groups according
to clinical manifestations and skin smear results. More commonly however,
patients exhibit features of both types (i.e. borderline leprosy).</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Paucibacillary (tuberculoid) leprosy:</strong> characterised by
1-5 hypopigmented or hyperpigmented anaesthetic macules or patches in an
asymmetric distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multibacillary (lepromatous) leprosy:</strong> multiple symmetrically
distributed skin lesions (papules, nodules or plaques) that may not exhibit
sensory loss.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Persons living in endemic areas in close contact with multibacillary cases
have an increased risk of being infected with leprosy.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Leprosy infection is diagnosed upon demonstration of acid-fast bacilli
in a slit skin smear or dermal nerve, or identification of non-caseating
granulomas with peripheral nerve involvement characteristic of leprosy
on histology.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Multidrug therapy is recommended for the treatment of leprosy. The type
and duration of treatment depends on the number of skin lesions (which
is an indication of bacillary load) – 6 months for paucibacillary and 12
months for multibacillary.</p>
<p>Leprosy is an important treatable cause of permanent physical disability.
Early treatment prevents or even reverses nerve damage. Measures to avoid
injury to anaesthetic limbs, and rehabilitation of disabled limbs are part
of the management of all leprosy patients.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard precautions apply in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>There is no available vaccine for leprosy (although the BCG vaccine is
partially protective).</p>
