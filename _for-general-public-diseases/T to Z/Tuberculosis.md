<summary>What is Tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease caused by the bacteria
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also
affect other parts of your body, such as the brain, lymph nodes, the kidneys,
bones, and joints. While curable, TB remains a significant public health
concern globally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Singapore, TB is endemic and latent TB infection is not uncommon in
our population.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2023, there were 1,201 new cases of active TB disease among Singapore
residents. This is lower than the 1,251 cases in 2022. The incidence rate
was 28.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2023, compared to 30.4 cases per
100,000 in 2022. Please refer to <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-tuberculosis-situation-in-singapore-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOH’s latest update</a> for

<summary>What are the Types of Tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>When the body fails to kill or contain the bacteria, it is known as active
TB disease. This means that the bacteria is actively multiplying and is
contagious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, not all individuals who are exposed to an infectious individual
will get active TB disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some people who are infected develop latent TB infection (LTBI), where
the body is able to stop the bacteria from growing, rendering them inactive.
This means the bacteria is still present in your body, but you do not have
any symptoms (e.g., cough) and cannot spread TB to others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In most healthy persons with LTBI (90%), TB bacteria remains inactive
throughout their life.&nbsp; About 5% develop active TB within the first
two years following infection and another 5% may develop active TB disease
later during their lifetime, especially as they age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The prevalence of LTBI increases with age, ranging from 2% for persons
between 18 and 29 years old to 29% for those between 70 and 79 years old.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How is Tuberculosis Disease Transmitted?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is an airborne disease. TB disease spreads through the air when an
infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission usually requires close
and prolonged exposure to the TB bacteria. It can be worsened by being
enclosed in areas with poor ventilation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TB disease cannot be spread by shaking someone’s hand, kissing, touching
bed linens, or sitting on toilet seats.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What are the Symptoms of Tuberculosis Disease?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptoms of TB disease include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Persistent cough (lasting more than 3 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coughing blood or sputum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night sweats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chest pain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>TB disease is curable and the spread of TB is preventable. Early detection
and prompt treatment is key. If you have symptoms of TB, go see a doctor
immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to go for a chest X-ray and put you through a
series of clinical and laboratory investigations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Untreated TB can lead to severe lung damage, disability, or death.</p>

<summary>Someone I Am Close To Has Been Diagnosed with Tuberculosis Disease. What
Should I Do?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Those who have prolonged and close contact with someone who has active
TB disease may be contacted by the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP)
for TB screening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screening at the National Tuberculosis Care Centre (NTBCC) are scheduled
by appointment. You will receive a SMS with the date and time of the appointment.
You may call the centre to change the appointment date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screening for TB may involve a <strong>QuantiFERON (TB) </strong>blood
test and a chest X-ray, if required. A repeat test may be scheduled by
the centre. The results will be out in two to three weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a positive blood test result, further tests (i.e., chest X-ray)
are required to determine if it is latent TB infection or active TB disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your blood test result is negative, it means you are not infected with
TB bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TB screening is fully subsidised for registered contacts. Only those who
have been identified as close contacts of active TB cases are offered screening
under the National TB Programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is advisable for these individuals to go for screening to protect themselves
and their loved ones from getting active TB disease.</p>

<p>Q: What If an Identified Contact Show Symptoms of Active TB Disease?
<br>Please advise them to seek medical attention and inform the doctor of
their status as an identified contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctor will assess whether he/she has TB and will inform the National
Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP) if the person is suspected to have TB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Do Identified Contacts Need To Be Isolated?</p>
<p>Identified contacts do not need to be isolated. They can proceed with
their daily work unless they are tested positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: When is It Safe for the Person Who was Diagnosed with Active TB Disease
To Return to the Office?</p>
<p>He/she will be considered non-infectious after two weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He/she will be required to visit the polyclinic or the National Tuberculosis
Screening Centre daily or a few times a week, as advised by the doctor,
to take his/her medication until he/she completes treatment. The employee
may request for a memo from the doctor for their follow-up appointments
if the organisation requires it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Can We Arrange for Our Own Screening and Claim from MOH?</p>
<p>TB screening at the National Tuberculosis Screening Centre is fully subsidised
only for identified contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOH will not bear the costs for privately arranged screening or screening
for non-identified contacts.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How are Active Tuberculosis Disease and Latent TB Infection Treated?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Active TB disease is treated with a combination of anti-TB medication,
administered for at least six to nine months. It is important for TB patients
to complete the course of treatment, even if they feel better after the
infectious period (first two weeks), as TB disease may recur or become
resistant to medication, which becomes extremely difficult to treat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For maximum efficacy, TB patients take their medication under the direct
observation of a healthcare worker. This is called the Directly Observed
Therapy (DOT). This ensures that patients take the correct dosage and combination
of medication, and are monitored to avoid treatment failure, drug resistance,
and further spread of TB. Should their condition worsen, they may require
hospitalisation or isolation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After two months of intensive treatment under the DOT, patients may take
their medication via an online video call with the nurse. This is called
the Synchronous Video Observed Therapy (S-VOT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Persons with LTBI will be offered preventive treatment if suitable. It
is important for these individuals to complete the course of their treatment
(about four to six months) to reduce the risk of developing active TB disease
in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Vaccine is available, it is only
effective in protecting babies from TB meningitis and widespread TB. It
offers limited protection against pulmonary (lung) TB, which is the most
common form among adults.</p>

<h2>About the National Tuberculosis Programme</h2>
<p>The National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP) is a national TB prevention
and care programme aimed at protecting the people of Singapore from the
disease. It was launched by the Ministry of Health in 1997 to further its
vision of a TB-free Singapore with people-centred care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;NTBP is led by the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA), which uses
a multi-pronged approach to control TB. This approach includes &nbsp;prompt
diagnosis and management of the disease; effective contact tracing and
screening; community engagement to raise public awareness; strengthening
partnerships, and implementing sustainable strategies.</p>
