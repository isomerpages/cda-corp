<summary><strong>What is Influenza?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Influenza, also known as the flu, is an infection caused by influenza
viruses. There are three main types - Type A, Type B and Type C. Influenza
A(H1N1-2009), Influenza A(H3N2) and Influenza B are the most common influenza
viruses circulating globally and in Singapore. Influenza C is associated
with mild sporadic illness and occurs less frequently.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is Influenza Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Influenza is spread from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets
and secretions released during coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>The virus can also be spread indirectly when a person touches a contaminated
surface (e.g. doorknob, utensils) then touches his or her nose or mouth.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 2 days, ranging from 1 to 4 days.</p>
<p>Infected persons may be contagious from 1 day before the onset of symptoms
until 5 to 7 days after onset.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Potential Complications of Influenza?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most cases of influenza are self-limiting. However, influenza can lead
to severe complications such as pneumonia, myocarditis, encephalitis, sepsis,
or even death.</p>
<p>The following people are at higher risk for complications related to influenza
infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Persons aged 65 years or older;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children aged 6 months to under 5 years;</p>

<p>Adults and children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalisation
due to chronic metabolic diseases, renal, neurologic, hepatic, or haematologic
disorders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adults and children with immunosuppression;</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, antihistamines, plenty of fluids,
and adequate bed rest is usually sufficient in the management of acute
symptoms of influenza.</p>

symptoms, as well as promote recovery. They are most effective within the
first two days of illness.</p>

infection. People living with and caring for high-risk individuals should
also be vaccinated against influenza.</p>

for Singaporean who are in the high risk groups. Visit the Healthhub
