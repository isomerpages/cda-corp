<summary><strong>What is Dengue?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Dengue is a disease by the dengue virus, which is transmitted to humans
via the bite of an infective mosquito. There are four different serotypes
of dengue virus (DENV1 to 4) circulating in the world, including Singapore.
Hence, individuals can be infected with dengue up to four times.</p>
<p>Together with the National Environment Agency (NEA), we provide regular
weekly updates on all dengue cases and track dengue-related deaths in Singapore
which are reported quarterly.</p>

<summary><strong>How is Dengue Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Dengue fever is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infective <em>Aedes</em> mosquito.
A mosquito becomes infected after it takes a blood meal from a dengue-infected
person. It becomes infective after an extrinsic incubation period of 8
to 12 days. The mosquito then remains infective for the rest of its lifespan.
When a person is bitten by an infective mosquito, they may develop symptoms
after an intrinsic incubation period of 4 to 7 days (ranges from 3 to 14
days). Notably, up to 75% of dengue infections are asymptomatic. Dengue
fever does not spread from person to person.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 4 to 7 days, ranging from 3 to 14 days.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of Dengue?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The symptoms of Dengue typically appear 4 to 7 days after being bitten
(ranges from 3 to 14 days).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sudden onset of fever for 2 to 7 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe headache, pain behind the eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint and muscle pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin rashes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mild bleeding (such as nose or gum bleed, or easy bruising of the skin)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you have dengue fever, <strong>seek medical attention</strong> at
your primary care doctor. <strong>Use mosquito repellent regularly</strong> if
you are diagnosed with dengue or suspected to have dengue, to protect your
loved ones and others living around you. Repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide),
Picaridin or IR3535 as the active ingredient are the most effective in
repelling mosquitoes.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Potential Complications of Dengue?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>First-time dengue infections can be severe, especially among the elderly
and those with pre-existing medical conditions and repeat dengue infections
have been associated with a higher occurrence of severe dengue. In rare
cases, dengue fever may progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue
shock syndrome. These are severe forms of the infection that can result
in death. Symptoms of severe dengue may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bleeding (e.g. gum or nose bleed, black stool, blood in vomit or stool)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent vomiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abdominal pain or tenderness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restlessness or lethargy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning signs usually begin 1 to 2 days after your fever has subsided.
If you have any of these warning signs, <strong>seek medical attention immediately</strong>.
Severe dengue is considered an emergency and requires immediate medical
care.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat Dengue?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There is no specific treatment for dengue fever, or its more serious forms,
dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Treatment for dengue
is supportive. In more severe cases, you may be hospitalised for aggressive
emergency treatment, including fluid and electrolyte replacement, and/or
blood transfusions.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent Dengue?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Mosquito Bite Prevention</strong>
</p>
<p>You can prevent mosquito bites by applying mosquito repellent, wearing
long, covered clothing, sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh
screens or air-conditioned rooms.</p>
<p>You should use mosquito repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide),
picaridin or IR3535 as the active ingredient, as they are more effective
and/or have longer mosquito repelling effects than “natural” repellents
that use plant-based extracts, such as citronella, eucalyptus, and other
essential oils. Use mosquito repellent regularly if you are living in or
visiting either dengue clusters or areas with higher <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito
population.</p>
<p>You should download NEA’s myENV mobile app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/myenv/id444435182" class="focus-visible:bg-utility-highlight focus-visible:text-base-content-strong focus-visible:decoration-transparent focus-visible:shadow-focus-visible focus-visible:outline-0 focus-visible:transition-none focus-visible:hover:decoration-transparent outline-none outline-0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&amp;hl=en_SG&amp;pli=1" class="focus-visible:bg-utility-highlight focus-visible:text-base-content-strong focus-visible:decoration-transparent focus-visible:shadow-focus-visible focus-visible:outline-0 focus-visible:transition-none focus-visible:hover:decoration-transparent outline-none outline-0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>),
which provide users with updates on dengue clusters and areas with higher <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito
population.</p>
<p><strong>Mosquito Breeding Prevention</strong>
</p>
<p>Preventing the spread of dengue is also about maintaining vigilance in
your environment. The <em>Aedes</em> mosquito has a distinctive black and
white striped body, and prefers to breed in clean, stagnant water. By frequently
checking and removing stagnant water from your home, you can help to prevent
the spread of dengue fever. For more advice on preventing <em>Aedes</em> mosquito
breeding, you can visit the <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika" class="focus-visible:bg-utility-highlight focus-visible:text-base-content-strong focus-visible:decoration-transparent focus-visible:shadow-focus-visible focus-visible:outline-0 focus-visible:transition-none focus-visible:hover:decoration-transparent outline-none outline-0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">National Environment Agency</a> website.</p>
<p><strong>Dengue Vaccine</strong>
</p>
<p>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has approved a dengue vaccine, <em>Dengvaxia</em>,
for individuals aged 12 to 45 years old. This is the only licensed dengue
vaccine in Singapore. Dengvaxia can be useful for individual protection
for persons in this age range who have been previously infected with dengue.</p>
<p>The vaccine is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended for those without prior
dengue infection. If you are keen to be vaccinated for personal protection,
consult your doctor as to whether Dengvaxia is appropriate for you.</p>
