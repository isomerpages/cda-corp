<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease of variable clinical manifestations.
Leptospira is a spiral organism and a member of the order Spirochaetales
found mainly in infected wild and domestic animals (e.g. rodents or dogs,
horses, cattle and pigs).</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Transmission occurs through direct contact with urine, fluids or tissues
of infected animals or with a urine-contaminated environment (e.g. through
swimming, wading in flood-waters, accidental immersion, occupation immersion,
contaminated moist soil or vegetation). The bacteria enters the body through
cuts or abrasions on the skin, or through the mucous membranes of the mouth,
nose and eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incubation period: Typically, 5-14 days; range is 2 to 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infectious period: Person-to-person transmission is rare.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The clinical manifestations of leptospirosis are variable. In majority
of cases, infection is asymptomatic or presents as a mild flu-like illness.
In some, the disease can be severe and even fatal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clinical course usually has 2 phases. In the initial phase, patients
experience an acute onset of high fever, myalgias and headache (retro-orbital
and frontal). About a third of cases have conjunctival suffusion (presents
as conjunctival redness), which is a frequently overlooked sign. Some patients
recover, but others progress on to a second phase that is more severe with
prolonged fever and systematic complications – jaundice and renal failure
(Weil’s disease), pulmonary haemorrhage with respiratory failure, and aseptic
meningitis or meningoencephalitis.</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Serological tests are most frequently used in the laboratory diagnosis

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In mild cases, oral antibiotics (doxycycline 100mg BD for 7 days) can
be given. Severe cases will require hospitalisation for intravenous antibiotics
(penicillin or ceftriaxone) and management of complications. Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction may occur following antimicrobial therapy.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standard precautions apply in healthcare settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epidemiological investigations should be carried out to identify the source
of infection and to implement control measures (e.g. rodent control). The
most important control measures for preventing human leptospirosis include
avoiding potential sources of infection such as stagnant water and animal
farm water runoff, rodent control, and protection of food from animal contamination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines to specific serovars have been developed and used in specific
circumstances (occupational exposures) but is not widely available.</p>
