<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) of the genital
tract caused by the protozoan <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>. Women are
the main carriers of the disease; men who are infected men are usually
asymptomatic.</p>
<p>It is a preventable and curable STI. However, reinfection appears to be
common.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>T. vaginalis</em> is the most common non-viral STI. Globally, there
were an estimated 156 million new cases of&nbsp;<em>T. vaginalis</em>&nbsp;infection
among people aged 15–49 years old in 2020 (73.7 million in females, 82.6
million in males). Approximately one third of the new infections occur
in the African region, followed by Regions of the Americas.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>T. vaginalis</em> is most often transmitted through vaginal, anal,
or oral intercourse with an infected individual.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> 5 to 28 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Unknown but is presumed to last until
treatment is completed. If untreated, it may persist for months or years.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Vaginal trichomoniasis may be asymptomatic (up to 50%) or cause abnormal
vaginal discharge (the classical frothy yellow-green discharge occurs in
10-30%), vulval itching, dysuria, or offensive odour. Other signs include
vulvitis, vaginitis and 2% of patients have strawberry cervix. Up to 50%
of men with <em>T. vaginalis </em>are asymptomatic and usually present as
sexual partners of infected women. Some male patients may have symptoms
of urethritis and rarely balanoposthitis.</p>
<p>If untreated, <em>T. vaginalis </em>infection in pregnant women is associated
with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature rupture of membranes,
preterm delivery, and delivery of a low birthweight infant. <em>T. vaginalis </em>infection
at delivery may predispose to maternal postpartum sepsis.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use if the relationship is not monogamous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past history or current presence of other STIs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A previous episode of trichomoniasis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAAT), which offers the highest
sensitivity for the detection of <em>T. vaginalis </em>and should be the
test of choice where available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Culture has a sensitivity of (75-96%) compared to microscopy and can detect <em>T. vaginalis </em>in
men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wet-mount microscopy can also be used but this is not a sensitive test
in men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Point-of-care test e.g. OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Genzyme Diagnostics,
USA) has demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trichomonads are sometimes reported on cervical cytology (sensitivity
~ 60-80%) but there is a high false-positive rate of about 30%. Use of
liquid-based PAP smear testing has shown enhanced sensitivity. The diagnosis
should still be confirmed by direct microscopy of vaginal secretions or
culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All women should be screened for other STIs and HIV.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should be treated.</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for <em>T. vaginalis</em> in adults:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Metronidazole 400-500mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metronidazole 2g orally single dose or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tinidazole 2g orally single dose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations in pregnancy:</p>
<p><em>T. vaginalis </em>infection has been associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes; all infected pregnant women should be treated. Metronidazole
in pregnancy has not been shown to be teratogenic or mutagenic and can
be used during all stages of pregnancy or breastfeeding. Imidazole and
metronidazole pessaries may be used to provide symptomatic relief, but
oral metronidazole is needed for eradication of infection.</p>
<p>Metronidazole is secreted in breast milk and may affect its taste. Avoid
high doses if breastfeeding or if using a single dose of metronidazole,
breastfeeding should be discontinued for 12-24 hours to reduce infant exposure.</p>
<p>Persistent symptoms:</p>
<p>Patients with persistent symptoms treated with either regimen should be
retreated with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Metronidazole 400mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If treatment failure occurs again (and reinfection, non-compliance excluded),
treat with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Metronidazole 2g orally daily for 5-7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure after the third regimen should prompt antibiotic resistance testing.</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Follow-up is unnecessary for asymptomatic patients.</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Prevention of <em>T. vaginalis:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inform current or recent sexual partners if a diagnosis of <em>T. vaginalis </em>has
been confirmed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not having sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<p>Sex partners within four weeks prior to presentation of symptoms (or last
sexual partner if more than four weeks) should be treated on epidemiological
grounds and screened for other STIs. They should be advised to abstain
from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been adequately
treated and any symptoms have resolved. There is evidence to suggest that
patient-delivered partner therapy might have a role in partner management
for trichomoniasis.</p>
