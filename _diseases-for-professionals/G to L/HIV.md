<summary><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that attacks the immune
system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system
fight off infections. If left untreated, HIV can cause a weakened immune
system or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a late or
advanced stage of HIV infection that occurs when the CD4 cell count falls
below 200 cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>or when an individual develops one or more
opportunistic infections regardless of the CD4 count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIV can be treated and prevented with antiretroviral therapy (ART). While
there is no cure for HIV, it is now considered a manageable chronic condition.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>According to the UNAIDS, approximately 1.3 million people are diagnosed
with HIV worldwide and 630,000 people died of AIDS-related illness in 2022.
It disproportionately affects resource-poor countries and certain groups
of populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers
and their clients, and people who inject drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022, there were 202 new cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infections&nbsp;reported among Singapore residents. 51% of the new cases
had late-stage HIV infection&nbsp;when they were diagnosed. Sexual intercourse
remains the main mode of HIV transmission, accounting for 93% of the cases.
Heterosexual transmission accounted for 37% of all cases, while 51% and
4% of the cases were due to homosexual and bisexual transmissions respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus I and II</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV is primarily transmitted through contact with certain bodily fluids
(blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids) from a person with HIV,
sharing of contaminated needles and syringes, and from mother to child
during childbirth or breastfeeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> The time from infection to development
of detectable antibodies is generally 1 to 3months. Between 1 and 6 weeks
(median 3 weeks) after exposure to HIV, some infected individuals may develop
a mononucleosis-like illness referred to as the acute retroviral syndrome.
Without treatment, about half of infected adults will develop AIDS within
10 years after infection.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Infectious throughout the entire duration
of the infection, but most infectious during the period of seroconversion
and untreated late-stage disease when the viral load (measured as number
of HIV copies/ml plasma) is very high. However, if patient achieves durable
viral suppression on treatment, they will not be able to transmit the virus
to their sexual partner, a concept known as undetectable equals untransmittable
(U=U).</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV infection progresses through four different stages:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Seroconversion illness/Acute retroviral syndrome</u>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mononucleosis-like illness. Combination of more than one of the following
symptoms: fever, adenopathy, rash, sore throat, myalgia, diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting, headache, weight loss or oral thrush. Some have oral and genital
ulcerations and neurological illnesses (e.g. aseptic meningitis). The symptoms
usually resolve spontaneously in most patients. Majority of infected cases
experience this but condition is under-diagnosed. The median duration is
20 days (range from &lt;1 week to 3 months).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Asymptomatic (“latent”) disease</u>
<br>No specific symptoms or signs of infection, but active viral replication
and immune destruction (declining CD4 counts) is occurring throughout this
period. Lymphadenopathy (often not noticed by patient) is usually present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Symptomatic disease</u>
<br>Symptoms include: Fever, weight loss, persistent generalised lymphadenopathy,
skin and oral conditions (oral thrush, hairy leukoplakia, herpes zoster,
recurrent herpes simplex) and immunological conditions (e.g. idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, multiple drug allergies)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>AIDS</u>
</p>
<p>The development of a specific indicator disease including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Viral: Persistent HSV ulceration (&gt;1 month); CMV retinitis or disease
other than liver, spleen, lymph node involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bacterial: tuberculosis (esp. extrapulmonary); atypical mycobacteria infections;
recurrent bacterial pneumonia (2 or more episodes in one year); recurrent
non-typhoid-salmonella septicaemia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fungi: oesophageal candidiasis; cryptococcal meningitis; histoplasmosis
(extra-pulmonary); Pneumocystis&nbsp;<em>jiroveci&nbsp;</em>pneumonia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protozoa: cerebral toxoplasmosis; cryptosporidial diarrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selected tumours (e.g. non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, CNS lymphoma, Kaposi’s
sarcoma, cervical cancer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others: wasting; dementia; progressive multi-focal leucoencepholopathy)</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with a person who has a HIV detectable viral load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use if the relationship is not monogamous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging in sexual activities under the influence of alcohol or other
drugs</p>

<li>
<p>Sharing needles, syringes or other drug injection equipment</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV testing can be classified into rapid and conventional. Rapid point-of-care
tests (POCT) tests can be done directly at the site and yield results in
15 to 20 minutes. If a rapid HIV test returns positive, a separate blood
sample for a confirmatory HIV lab test must be done before the diagnosis
can be confirmed. Conventional tests are those in which blood is collected
and then sent to the laboratory for testing. Results from conventional
tests are typically available from a few hours to a few days. HIV self-testing
kits are also available as of August 2022 as part of a pilot programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIV tests are very accurate, but no test can detect the virus immediately
after infection. The window period varies from person to person and is
also dependent on the type of HIV test. A negative test should be repeated
1 and 3 months after the last high-risk exposure for confirmation.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>ART is recommended for all individuals with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell
count. It should be started for all individuals within 2 weeks of presentation
to care, barring several exceptions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) Tuberculosis (TB): We recommend that ART be started within 2 weeks
of TB treatment initiation for patients with a CD4 count less than 50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,
but started within 2-8 weeks of TB treatment initiation if the CD4 count
is more than 50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) CMV retinitis: The optimal timing of ART initiation should be individualized.
Joint management by a HIV physician and an ophthalmologist with expertise
in managing CMV retinitis is required.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) CNS opportunistic infections (OIs): We recommend that ART be delayed
in patients with CNS OIs until specific treatment for these OIs has been
initiated, and clinical improvement observed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The goals of ART treatment are to achieve undetectable HIV viral loads,
to reduce HIV-associated morbidity, prolong the duration and quality of
survival, and prevent HIV transmission.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The NHIVP recommends that all persons aged more than 21 years old or those
