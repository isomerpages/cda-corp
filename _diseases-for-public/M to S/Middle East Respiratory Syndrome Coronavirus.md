<summary><strong>What is MERS?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease
caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The virus was first reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) on
22 September 2012. Till date, MERS-CoV infection has been reported in at
least 27 countries with majority of cases reported in the Middle East region.
MOH has been closely monitoring the global MERS situation since the disease
emerged in 2012. To date, there has been no reported case of MERS in Singapore
but the possibility of an imported case here cannot be ruled out given
todayâ€™s globalised travel patterns. There has been no evidence of sustained
community spread and transmission of the virus from person to person had
occurred mainly in healthcare settings.</p>

<summary><strong>How is MERS Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>MERS-CoV is present in infected dromedary camels, and can be transmitted
to humans through contact with infected animals or consumption or exposure
to contaminated animal products. MERS-CoV may also spread through close
contact with infected persons.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 1 to 14 days.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent MERS?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To reduce risk of exposure to MERS-CoV, we advise travellers to affected
areas to maintain their vigilance and adopt the following health precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observe and practise good personal hygiene at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands regularly with soap, especially before handling food or
eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirty from coughing
or sneezing. If water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser
that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid close contact with persons who are unwell or have symptoms of infectious
diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and dispose
the soiled tissue into the bin immediately. Avoid touching your face, including
eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands after coughing or sneezing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat food that have been fully cooked and wash fruits and vegetables before
eating them. Avoid eating raw or undercooked meat and seafood, milk/milk
products, and food prepared in unhygienic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid contact with camels and other animals, including not visiting camel
farms. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid visiting healthcare institutions in the Middle East unless it is
necessary to do so as part of accessing medical care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear a surgical mask in crowded places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the required and/or recommended vaccinations (e.g. COVID-19,
meningococcal and influenza vaccination) are up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon returning from a MERS-CoV affected area, monitor your health closely
for two weeks. Wear a mask and seek medical attention promptly if you become
unwell or develop respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose, and
inform the doctor of your travel history.</p>
