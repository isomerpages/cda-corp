<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Syphilis is a systemic infection caused by <em>Treponema pallidum</em>.
It is a preventable and curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection
(STI).</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 7.1 million
adults aged 15–49 were diagnosed with syphilis worldwide. Some population
groups are disproportionately affected by syphilis, such as men who have
sex with men (MSM). This could be attributed to various factors, including
elevated levels of stigma and discrimination, as well as limited access
to healthcare services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the notified syphilis cases, the incidence rate of infectious syphilis
decreased from 8.6 per 100,000 population in 2019 to 5.1 in 2020 in Singapore;
and there were no cases of congenital syphilis in 2019 and two cases in
2020.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>Syphilis is transmitted during oral, anal or vaginal sex through direct
contact with infectious lesions.</p>
<p>An infected mother can also pass syphilis during pregnancy through the
placenta.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> from 10 to 90 days, with an average
of 21 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>During the primary and secondary stages
and possibly the first 2 years of the latent period. A person is no longer
infectious 5 days after starting appropriate antibiotic treatment or until
their symptoms resolve.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>Many people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syphilis has several stages:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Syphilis: Usually occurs 2-6 weeks following
infection. Characterized by a single or less often multiple, painless,
indurated ulcer (chancre) at the site of inoculation. Regional lymph nodes
are enlarged, feel rubbery and are painless.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary Syphilis: Usually occurs 2-6 months
following primary syphilis. Characterized by variable mucocutaneous and
systemic signs e.g. symmetrical non-itchy rashes, mucous membrane lesions,
patchy alopecia, generalised lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latent Syphilis: Asymptomatic phase with no
clinical signs of organ involvement. It is categorised into:</p>
<p>o&nbsp; Early latent syphilis (&lt;1 year of infection)</p>
<p>o&nbsp; Late latent syphilis (&gt;1 year of infection)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tertiary Syphilis: Occurs 5 to 10 years after
secondary syphilis and includes:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Benign tertiary syphilis characterized by gumma formation</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardiovascular syphilis</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Neurosyphilis</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p><em>T. pallidum </em>cannot be cultured on routine laboratory culture
media. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for <em>T. pallidum </em>DNA
is not commercially available. Test for diagnosis include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark-Field Microscopy
(DFM): useful in early syphilis, when antibodies are not yet detectable.
The diagnosis of syphilis may be confirmed by demonstrating <em>T. pallidum </em>on
wet mounts of secretions from the primary chancre, or moist lesions of
secondary syphilis.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serological tests:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Treponemal Tests (</u><em>Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) </em>test
and the <em>Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) </em>test) are monitored
serially to assess the serological response to treatment. A positive RPR/VDRL
test needs to be confirmed by a treponemal test.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Treponemal Tests (</u><em>Treponema Pallidum Haemagglutination Assay (TPHA)</em>, <em>Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination (TPPA) </em>test,
the <em>Line Immunoassay (LIA)</em>, the <em>Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-Abs</em>)
test, Rapid diagnostic tests (e.g. <em>Abbott Determine Syphilis TP</em>)
and the <em>treponemal EIA </em>test) are specific and can be used as screening
tests. Once positive, specific tests tend to remain positive even after
the syphilis has been successfully treated. The titres of treponemal tests
are not useful in monitoring treatment response.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</p>
<p>Parenteral penicillin G (aqueous crystalline, aqueous procaine, or benzathine)
is the drug of choice for treating all stages of syphilis. If the patient
is allergic to penicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin and
erythromycin are the alternatives. However, they do not have the established
and well-evaluated high rate of success of penicillin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for primary, secondary, or early latent:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benzathine Penicillin
G 2.4 million units intramuscularly (IM) single dose or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aq. Procaine Penicillin
G 600,000 units IM daily for 10 days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for late latent:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benzathine penicillin
G 2.4 million units IM weekly 3 doses (7.2 million units total) or</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aq. Procaine penicillin
G 600,000 units IM daily for 17-21 days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<p>Quantitative nontreponemal tests should be repeated for a total period
of two years (at 3 months; 6 months; 12 months; 18 months; 24 months).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following treatment of early syphilis, RPR/VDRL should demonstrate a 4x
(2 dilutions) decrease in titre within 6 months. Failure to do so probably
means treatment failure, and is an indication for retreatment with 3 injections
of Benzathine penicillin. Some experts recommend cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical signs that persist or recur, or a rising RPR/VDRL titre of 4x
or more suggests either reinfection or relapse. In these situations, CSF
examination is recommended before retreatment. Seroreversion in primary
syphilis often occurs within 12 months. It may take a longer time for secondary
and early latent syphilis, but usually occurs within 24 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For latent syphilis non-treponemal tests should be repeated at 6, 12,
and 24 months. Serologic response to treatment associated with multiple
factors, viz. syphilis stage, initial non-treponemal titres (&lt;1:8 are
less likely to decline four-fold), and age (titres in older patients might
be less likely to decrease fourfold than younger patients). These persons
should be examined for HIV infection and neurologic disease, clinical and
serologic follow-up annually. If additional follow-up cannot be ensured
or if an initially high titre (&gt;1:32) does not decrease at least four-fold
24 months after treatment, retreatment with weekly injections of benzathine
penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 3 weeks is recommended. Because treatment
failure might be the result of unrecognised CNS infection, CSF examination
can be considered in such situations where follow-up is uncertain or initial
high titres do not decrease after 24 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following treatment of late syphilis, seroreversion occurs rarely as a
stable, low titre, serological scar, is the result in most patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All patients treated for neurosyphilis should be followed up for life
at 6-month intervals. If CSF pleocytosis was present initially, CSF examinations
should be repeated every 6 to 12 months until the cell count returns to
normal. Serologic tests for HIV should be performed 3 months after the
last risky exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>Annual screening for syphilis symptoms and other STIs is recommended for
all individuals who are sexually active.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals with multiple
sex partners, change in sex partner, or engaging in unprotected sex should
consider regular screening</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All pregnant women should
be tested for syphilis during their first prenatal visit and thereafter,
if there is risk of infection from their regular partner</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More frequent screening
than annual might be indicated for certain individuals on the basis of
their risk behaviors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention of syphilis:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inform current or recent
sexual partners if a diagnosis of syphilis has been confirmed</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid sexual intercourse
until treatment is completed</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not having sex</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent and correct
use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the number of
sex partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get tested for STIs
regularly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>At risk partners are those who have been exposed within the following
periods: 3 months plus duration of symptoms for primary syphilis, 6 months
plus duration of symptoms for secondary syphilis, and 1 year for early
latent syphilis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epidemiologic treatment should be given to sexual contacts who were exposed
3 months prior to the diagnosis of primary, secondary or early latent syphilis,
if follow-up is uncertain. Sexual partners of late syphilis should be screened
and evaluated for syphilis, and treated on the basis of these findings.</p>
