<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA virus in the family <em>Picornaviridae</em>.
HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease unlike hepatitis B or
C. Acute hepatitis usually presents as a self-limited illness; development
of fulminant hepatitis is rare.</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>Outbreaks have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM), linked
to oro-anal or digital rectal contact. Outbreaks have also been reported
amongst intravenous drug users, in institutions for people with learning
difficulties, and in contaminated batches of factor VIII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, there were 81 serologically confirmed HAV infections in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>Transmission occurs via faeco-oral (via food, water, close personal contact)
route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> 15 to 45 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Patients are infectious for approximately
2 weeks before and 1 week after the jaundice by the non-parenteral routes
but virus can be found in the blood and stool until after the serum amino
transferase levels have peaked. In HIV positive patients, HAV viraemia
may continue for over 90 days.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>Most children and up to half of adults are asymptomatic or have mild non-specific
symptoms with little or no jaundice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In more ‘typical’ cases, there are 2 phases of symptoms:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prodromal illness: flu-like
symptoms (malaise, myalgia, fatigue), often with right upper abdominal
pain. This phase lasts for 3-10 days.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is followed by the icteric
illness: jaundice (hepatic and cholestatic) associated with anorexia, nausea,
fatigue, liver enlargement and tenderness, which usually lasts for 1-3
weeks. It can persist for 12 or more weeks in a minority of patients who
have cholestatic symptoms (itching and deep jaundice).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fulminant hepatitis complicates approximately 0.4% of cases, and is more
common in patients who are already infected with chronic hepatitis B or
C. Chronic infection (&gt;6 months) has only been reported in a very small
number of case-reports; overall mortality is &lt;0.1%.</p>

<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>
</p>
<p>Anyone who has not been vaccinated or previously infected can get infected
with HAV. In areas where HAV endemicity is high, most infections occur
during early childhood. Risk factors include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor sanitation</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of safe water</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living in a household
with an infected person</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a sexual partner
of someone with acute hepatitis A infection</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of recreational
drugs</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex between men</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travelling to areas
of high endemicity without being immunized</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>A diagnosis is confirmed by a positive serum Hepatitis A virus specific
IgM (HAV-IgM) that remains positive for six months or more.</p>
<p>HAV-IgG does not distinguish between current or past infection and may
remain positive for life. Antibody produced in response to HAV infection
persists for life and confers protection against reinfection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other tests include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serum amino-transferases
(AST/ALT)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilirubin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALP will usually be &lt;2x the upper limit of normal, but higher if there
is cholestasis. PT prolongation by more than 5 seconds suggests developing
hepatic decompensation.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to avoid food handling and unprotected sexual
intercourse until they have become non-infectious. They should also be
screened for other STIs in cases of sexually-acquired hepatitis or if otherwise
appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients with acute HAV infection usually require only supportive care.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mild/Moderate Icteric
Hepatitis (80%): Manage as an outpatient emphasizing rest and oral hydration</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe Icteric Hepatitis:
For patients with vomiting, dehydration or signs of hepatic decompensation
(change in conscious level or personality), consider admission to hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>Prevention:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vaccination against
hepatitis A is recommended by the CDC for <u>MSM, injecting drug users, and patients with chronic</u>  <u>liver disease</u>.
Post vaccination serologic testing is not recommended because most persons
respond to the vaccine.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hepatitis A single-antigen
vaccine may be given up to 14 days after exposure providing exposure was
within the infectious period of the source case (during the prodromal illness
or first week of jaundice).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is increasing
evidence that vaccine-induced immunity may be &gt;20 years and possibly
lifelong, so no further booster doses is currently recommended after the
primary course in immunocompetent patients.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A combined Hepatitis
A+B vaccine given on the same schedule as the hepatitis B vaccine has similar
efficacy to the individual vaccines although early immunity to hepatitis
B may be impaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner notification
should be performed for at-risk contacts (oral/anal, digital/rectal and
penetrative anal sex) within the period 2 weeks before to 1 week after
the onset of jaundice.</p>
