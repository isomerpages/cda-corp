<p>Overview</p>
<p>Mumps is a viral infection affecting the salivary glands. It is transmitted
through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets. Mumps is still
a common disease in many countries. Most people with mumps recover completely
within 2 weeks.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mumps occurs worldwide and usually affects children and young adults.
In countries that have included mumps vaccination in their immunisation
programmes, the incidence of mumps has declined significantly. Humans are
the only known reservoirs of the infection.</p>
<p>In Singapore, mumps vaccination has been included as part of the National
Childhood Immunisation Programme since January 1990, when the monovalent
measles vaccine was replaced by the trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
vaccine. In 1999 and 2000, there was a significant increase in the number
of cases due to the low protective efficacy of vaccines containing the
Rubini strain, which had been used in the years 1993-1995. Following the
resurgence in cases, a more efficacious vaccine replaced the Rubini strain-containing
vaccine. Since then, the incidence of mumps has declined rapidly and remained
low since 2010.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mumps is transmitted by droplet spread and direct or indirect (via fomites)
contact with respiratory droplets and saliva of an infected person.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Typically 16 to 18 days, range of 12
to 25 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> 1 week before and up to 9 days after
the onset of parotitis</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>About 30% of cases may present with a mild respiratory tract infection
with no apparent salivary gland swelling or a subclinical infection. Typically,
mumps begins with a prodrome of malaise, headache, fever and anorexia lasting
2-3 days. This is followed by pain and swelling in one or both parotid
glands (or other salivary glands), increasing for 2-3 days, then resolving
over 1 week. Epididymoorchitis, usually unilateral, is the most common
complication occurring in approximately 15-30% post pubertal males, typically
5-10 days after onset of parotitis. Other complications include oophoritis,
meningoencephalitis and sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
<p>Differentials for parotid gland swelling include bacterial parotitis,
other viral parotitis (parainfluenza, influenza, coxsackievirus), viral
lymphadenitis, parotid calculus or tumour. Bilateral parotid swelling can
be seen in children with HIV infection.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Young infants (&lt; 12 months old), elderly persons (&gt; 65 years old),
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated pregnant women, and immunocompromised
or immunosuppressed persons.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mumps infection is diagnosed when a laboratory test detects mumps virus
from clinical specimen (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs/aspirates, saliva, blood,
urine and CSF) through PCR/virus culture, or in serum samples via serology.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There is no specific antiviral therapy. Treatment is symptomatic.</p>
<p>Susceptible contacts should receive MMR vaccination.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard and droplet precautions apply in the healthcare settings. Infected
individuals should stay away from school or the workplace for 5-9 days
from the onset of parotid swelling.</p>
<p>Vaccination is the main preventive measure against mumps (see Public Health
Resources section). Currently under the National Childhood Immunisation
Schedule, the MMR first dose is given at 12 months and the second dose
at 15-18 months.</p>
<p>In an outbreak setting, exposed individuals who are unvaccinated may need
to be quarantined from 12 to 25 days after exposure.</p>
