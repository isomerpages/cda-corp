<p>The Communicable Diseases Agency Singapore (CDA) today unveiled a comprehensive
framework designed to strengthen national preparedness for future pandemics.
The framework outlines a multi-agency approach encompassing measures for
bolstering surveillance, enhancing public health capacity, and strengthening
social resilience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The development of the framework comes in the wake of valuable lessons
learned from the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Key features of the framework
are expected to include increased investment in disease surveillance systems,
amplified research in infectious diseases, and the development of targeted
public education campaigns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CDA also emphasized the importance of local and international collaboration
and knowledge sharing in effectively tackling future outbreaks. Singapore
is expected to play a leading role in regional and global efforts to combat
future pandemics.</p>
