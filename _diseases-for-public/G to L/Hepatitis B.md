<summary><strong>What is HBV?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver which can be acute (short-term)
or chronic. It is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be prevented
with vaccination.&nbsp;</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is HBV Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HBV is transmitted from person-to-person via blood or body fluids, and
can survive outside the body for at least seven days. This includes mother-to-child
transmission, blood transfusion, sharing of needles, sexual transmission,
and in rare cases, through improper handling of fluids in hospitals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incubation period of HBV ranges from 30 to 180 days. The virus may
be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection, which can develop into
chronic hepatitis HBV, especially when transmitted in infancy or childhood.</p>
<p>HBV infection in adults leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of
cases, compared to 95% for infants and children. This is why infant and
childhood vaccination for HBV is recommended.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of HBV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>People infected with HBV may not show any symptoms. When they show, they
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Jaundice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dark-coloured urine;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light-coloured stools;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor appetite;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abdominal pain; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nausea and vomiting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B is very serious. It can lead to complications like:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acute hepatitis (episode of liver inflammation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chronic hepatitis (permanent liver inflammation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver cirrhosis (permanent scarring and hardening of liver);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver failure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver cancer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who recover completely from HBV become immune to the disease. However,
there is a chance that person may become an HBV carrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hepatitis B carriers seldom show any symptoms. They can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Spread the disease to others; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop serious liver complications (listed above).</p>

<p>Like Hepatitis C (HCV), treatment is usually done in collaboration with
a hepatologist, a doctor who specialises in treating acute or chronic liver
disease.</p>

<p>Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all infants, children, adolescents
younger than 19 years. Adults aged 19 to 59 years, and those aged 60 years
and above with risk factors for HBV infection should also get vaccinated.</p>
<p>All infants should receive the HBV vaccine after birth, within 24 hours.
This is followed by two or three doses of HBV vaccine at least four weeks
apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For children, there are combination vaccines that protect against HBV
and other common illnesses. Combination vaccines include other necessary
childhood immunisations and are beneficial as it reduces the number of
shots a child must take at a time. Speak to your doctor to understand what
is recommended for your child.</p>
<p>In addition to getting vaccinated, ways to prevent getting HBV include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sexual partners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sharing needles or any equipment used for injecting drugs, piercing,
or tattooing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routine use of standard precaution when handling blood or bodily fluids. </p>
