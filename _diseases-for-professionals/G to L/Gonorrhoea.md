<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>,
an obligate human pathogen. The sites of infection include urethra, endocervix,
pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva.</p>
<p>Gonorrhoea is treatable and curable with antibiotics. However, <em>N. gonorrhoea </em>has
developed resistance to antibiotics, posing a challenge in its treatment.
Rational use of antibiotics is critical to decrease this threat.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 2020, World Health Organization estimated 82.4&nbsp;million new infections
with&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae&nbsp;</em>among adults aged 15 to 49 years.
Prevalence of gonorrhoea is highest among vulnerable populations such as
men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, transgender women and adolescents
and young people in high burden countries. Over the last decade, the incidence
of gonorrheal STIs has increased due to the rising number of antibiotic-resistant
strains.</p>
<p>In Singapore, gonorrhoea had the lowest incidence among the three legally
notifiable STIs in 2019 and 2020. It was more commonly reported in men.
No gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum cases were reported in 2019 and 2020.
Regarding gonorrhoea susceptibility, the percentage of gonorrhoea cultures
with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone decreased from 9.19% in 2019
to 7.33% in 2020. There was one resistant case detected in 2019 and no
cases detected in 2020. The percentage of gonorrhoea cultures resistant
to ciprofloxacin remained consistent at 81.1% in 2019 and 81.9% in 2020.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Gonorrhoea is usually transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse
with an infected individual. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhoea
to be transmitted or acquired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An infected mother can also transmit gonorrhoea to her baby during vaginal
delivery.</p>
<p>Incubation period: &nbsp;Average 3–5 days, sometimes longer.</p>
<p>Infectious period:<strong> </strong>Up to 7 days post-treatment.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Gonorrhoea is characterised clinically by a profuse purulent discharge
from the affected genital site (more than 80% in male urethritis, up to
50% in female cervicitis), often accompanied by local pain or discomfort.
However, asymptomatic infection may occur in 10% of urethral infection,
more than 50% of cervical infections, and more than 90% of pharyngeal infection
and rectal infections.</p>
<p>Men and women may experience different symptoms.</p>
<p>In men, common symptoms include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pain or burning sensation &nbsp;when urinating;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A white, yellow, or greenish discharge from the penis; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Painful or swollen testes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they
can include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pain or burning when urinating;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaginal discharge; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaginal bleeding between periods or during sexual intercourse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Infants born to mothers with gonorrhoea may develop an eye infection.
This causes redness, pain, soreness, ulcers, and tearing. This is preventable
with eye medications for newborns.</p>
<p>Contiguous spread of the infection may lead to epididymo-orchitis, prostatitis,
endometritis and salpingo-oophoritis. Haematogenous spread results in disseminated
gonococcal infection (DGI).</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use if the relationship is not monogamous;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who exchange sex for money or drugs; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History or current presence of other STIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea is made on finding Gram-negative
intracellular diplococci in a smear of the discharge. Confirmatory diagnosis
is made by identification of the organism on culture media (e.g. modified
Thayer-Martin agar).</p>
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAATs) (PCR) can be used as
diagnostic/screening tests on non-invasively collected specimens (urine
and self-taken vagina/pharyngeal/rectal swabs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect urethral and cervical,
pharyngeal, and rectal gonorrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because non-culture tests cannot provide anti-microbial susceptibility
results in cases of persistent gonococcal infection after treatment or
potential resistant infections, clinicians should perform both culture
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gonococcal complement fixation test (GC-CFT) should <strong><u>not</u></strong> be
used for diagnosing gonorrhoea.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the cervix,
urethra, or rectum:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ceftriaxone&nbsp;</strong>500mg IM in a single dose, plus <strong>Doxycycline&nbsp;</strong>100mg
orally 2 times a day, for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcai Infection of the pharynx:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ceftriaxone&nbsp;</strong>500mg IM in a single dose, plus <strong>Doxycycline&nbsp;</strong>100mg
orally 2 times a day, for 7 days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy considerations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cephalosporins in the recommended dosages are safe and effective in pregnancy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectinomycin can be administered to women who are unable to tolerate

</li>
<li>
<p>Simultaneous treatment for chlamydial infection with Azithromycin 1g orally

</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Test-of-cure and assessment for post-gonococcal urethritis (PGU) is performed
after 14 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test-of-cure culture tests are recommended in all cases at all sites,
especially for pharyngeal gonorrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases of possible antibiotic resistance, cultures should be performed
with additional antimicrobial sensitivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patients with gonococcal ophthalmia should have cultures done daily on
therapy. Repeat on day 5 and I14 after therapy completion date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serologic tests for syphilis and HIV should be performed; if negative
they should be repeated 3 months after the last at-risk exposure.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Annual screening for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infection is recommended for
all individuals who are sexually active.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individuals with multiple sex partners, change in sex partner, or engaging
in unprotected sex should consider regular screening; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More frequent screening than annual might be indicated for certain individuals
&nbsp;based on their risk behaviours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention of Gonorrhoea:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inform current or recent sexual partners if a diagnosis of gonorrhoea
has been confirmed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sexual intercourse until at least 7 days after treatment is completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not having sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sexual partners; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<p>Sexual contacts of the patients in the preceding 60 days should be traced,
screened, and treated on epidemiologic grounds. If the last sexual exposure
was more than 60 days, the patient’s most recent partner should be treated.</p>
