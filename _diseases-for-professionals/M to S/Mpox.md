<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Mpox is a viral disease that is caused by two distinct clades of the monkeypox
virus (MPXV), known as Clade I and II. Most common symptoms of the disease
are rash and fever. Serious complications or death can occur in medically
vulnerable individuals.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Prior to 2022, mpox were primarily reported in parts of Central (Clade
I) and West Africa (Clade II) where it is endemic. Almost all mpox cases
occurring outside of Africa were linked to international travel to endemic
regions or through imported animals.</p>
<p>2022 – 2023 global outbreak of MPXV Clade IIb: In May 2022, cases of mpox
caused by MPXV Clade IIb were reported concurrently in multiple countries
outside of Africa, which were not historically known to be endemic to mpox,
including in Singapore. On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of mpox to be a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC) due to its global spread. The PHEIC status
was subsequently lifted on 10 May 2023 following a global decline in mpox
cases and deaths. Nonetheless, mpox continues to be transmitted at low
levels globally.</p>
<p>2023 – 2024 outbreak in Africa: In 2023, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) reported a significant increase in mpox cases and deaths. Unlike
the global outbreak associated with MPXV Clade IIb, the virus circulating
in the DRC is of the endemic Clade I, which has thus far only been detected
within the African continent. From July 2024, several countries in the
region, including those where historically mpox Clade I was not endemic,
have also reported mpox cases and outbreaks.</p>
<p>On 14 August 2024, the WHO declared that the mpox outbreak in the DRC
and the growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a PHEIC. This
follows the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s declaration
of a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security on 13 August 2024.
While there is cross-border spread of mpox Clade I in parts of Central
and East Africa, the Clade I outbreak has thus far largely remained within
the African continent. Outside of Africa, mpox Clade I has only been detected
in Sweden, Thailand and India which have each reported one case in travellers
since August 2024, but which have not led to further local spread. &nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>MPXV is a member of the&nbsp;<em>Orthopoxvirus</em>&nbsp;genus in the&nbsp;<em>Poxviridae</em>&nbsp;family.
There are two genetic clades: Clade I and Clade II</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox can spread through physical contact with infected individuals, skin
lesions and body fluids, contaminated materials and environments, or exposure
to respiratory secretions. The virus can also spread from animals to humans,
e.g. through bite or scratch from an infected animal, bush meat preparation,
or direct contact with the blood, body fluids, or skin or mucosal lesions
of infected animals.</p>
<p>In the global outbreak of MPXV Clade IIb, the main mode of transmission
is via close physical or prolonged contact, such as face to face and skin
to skin contact including sexual contact. Many cases have been identified
in individuals who reported intimate contact (including sexual contact)
with infected people. Cases have also been reported where infection was
attributed to household transmission. Regardless of sexual orientation,
persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviours, such as having multiple
or casual sexual partners are most at risk of infection in the context
of the current outbreak.</p>
<p>Food (other than bushmeat) has never been identified as being associated
with human cases of mpox. Currently, there is also no evidence that food
or food packaging is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus.
As such, the risk of mpox transmission through food is low. Please refer
to <a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/disease-outbreaks-and-food-safety-incidents#monkeypox-0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SFA's website</a> for
more information.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period</strong>: Typically 5 to 21 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>From onset of symptoms until all lesions
have healed and scabs have fallen off</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Clade I infections have historically been characterised by more severe
disease than Clade II infections. Based on currently available data, individuals
who are at higher risk of severe illness include young children, pregnant
women or immunocompromised individuals.</p>
<p>Symptoms for both clades are indistinguishable and may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Skin rash often starting from the face before becoming generalized including
involvement of palms and soles. However, presentation in the global outbreak
of Clade II involves only a few or single localised lesions, especially
in the genital and groin areas, which do not spread further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swollen lymph nodes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle ache</p>

<li>
<p>General feeling of exhaustion or profound weakness</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Relevant travel history to countries endemic of mpox; contact with infected
animals; preparation or consumption of bush meat; close contact with confirmed
cases, including sexual or intimate in-person contact with persons in a
social or sexual network experiencing mpox activity.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox infection is diagnosed when MPXV is detected on swabs (e.g. swabs
of vesicles; throat swabs and blood are less preferred due to lower sensitivity)
through PCR.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Treatment is typically symptomatic.
<br>The MVA-BN (JYNNEOS), a third-generation smallpox vaccine, is currently
available as Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for persons who have been
identified to be close contacts of confirmed mpox cases. While JYNNEOS
is estimated to provide over 80% protection against mpox, current data
remains limited in concluding the level and duration of protection conferred
by vaccination, and persons are advised to continue adhering to the recommended
precautions against the disease.</p>
<p>In line with international recommendations, mass population-wide vaccination
is currently not recommended as a preventive strategy for mpox, as the
risk to the general public remains low with disease transmission predominantly
via close physical or prolonged contact.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Members of the public are strongly advised to maintain vigilance and take
the following precautions, where relevant:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Observe and practise good personal hygiene at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands regularly with soap, especially before handling food or
eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirty from coughing
or sneezing. If water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser
that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid contact with persons who are unwell (e.g., those with rash or other
lesions).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sharing common items that may be contaminated with bodily fluids.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>When travelling, avoid feeding or touching animals, especially stray or
wild animals, and the consumption of bush meat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travellers from countries affected by mpox should monitor for symptoms
for 21 days upon their return from these countries. Please refer to&nbsp;
