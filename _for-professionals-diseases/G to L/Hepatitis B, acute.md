<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus
(HBV). HBV is a DNA virus belonging to the <em>Hepadnavirus </em>family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hepatitis B can be prevented with vaccination.</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>HBV universal vaccination was introduced in Singapore on 1 Sep 1987. The
prevalence of HBsAg among children and adolescents aged 5-17 years was
0.4% in a seroprevalence study conducted between 2008 and 2010. The overall
HBsAg prevalence among Singapore residents aged 18-69 years was 3.6% in
2010, corresponding to an intermediate prevalence area as defined by WHO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Singapore, a total of 44 cases of acute HBV infections were reported
in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>HBV is transmitted from person-to-person via blood or body fluids. Recognized
modes of transmission include mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusion,
nosocomial infection, sharing of needles and sexual transmission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The predominant mode of transmission of HBV depends on the prevalence.
Mother-to-child transmission is the major route of transmission in high-prevalence
areas, while injection drug abuse and unprotected sexual intercourse are
the predominant mode of transmission in low prevalence countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> 1 to 4 months</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>From 2 weeks before the onset of jaundice
until the patient becomes surface antigen negative</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>In adults, approximately 70% with acute HBV infection are asymptomatic.
The remaining 30% may experience a prodromal serum-sickness-like phase
followed by constitutional symptoms such as jaundice, nausea, malaise and
right upper quadrant pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fulminant hepatic failure is uncommon, occurring in about 0.1 to 0.5%
of patients. There is increased risk of fulminant or more severe hepatitis
in patients who are co-infected with other hepatitis viruses and HIV, took
acetaminophen during the illness or who are drug abusers, especially methamphetamine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neonates with HBV infection rarely show clinical features or transaminitis
at birth. A small number develop acute hepatitis by 2 months of age, presenting
with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes.</p>

<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>
</p>
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unprotected sex with
an infected person</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having multiple sex
partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inconsistent condom
use if the relationship is not monogamous</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past history or current
presence of other STIs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IVDU) are
considered at risk groups for HBV acquisition. HBV is also endemic in Southeast
Asia therefore vaccination is recommended for the general population.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>The order of appearance of markers in acute infections is HBsAg, HBeAg,
anti-HBc IgM, anti-HBe, anti- HBc IgG, anti-HBs. Acute HBV infection is
diagnosed when HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM is detected.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</p>
<p>Treatment should normally be given in collaboration with a hepatologist,
or physician experienced in the management of liver disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to avoid unprotected sexual intercourse until
they have become non-infectious or their partners have been successfully
vaccinated. They should also be screened for other STIs in cases thought
to have been sexually acquired or if otherwise appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most patients with acute HBV infection, treatment is mainly supportive.
In immunocompetent adults, less than 1% develop liver failure, while less
than 5% progress to chronic HBV infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In patients with severe liver disease such as those with coagulopathy,
marked jaundice or with persistent symptoms, tenofovir or entecavir can
be used as monotherapy until the patient has cleared HBsAg (2 tests done
4 weeks apart).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Considerations in pregnancy and breastfeeding:</strong>
</p>
<p>The risk of vertical transmission of HBV from HBsAg positive mothers is
as high as 90% in women who are HBeAg positive. This risk is about 30%
in HBeAg negative mothers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New-borns of mothers who test positive for HBsAg should receive both passive
and active immunization (using Hepatitis B specific immunoglobulin) within
12 hours of delivery at different sites. Infants should go on to complete
the whole HBV immunization series. Even with passive-active immunization,
children born to HBeAg positive mothers remained at risk of transmission
(about 9%).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infants who received HBV active-passive immunization at birth can be breastfed.
The infant should complete the hepatitis B vaccine series. However, for
mothers who require antiviral treatment, the safety of antiviral therapy
during breastfeeding is currently unclear.</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>HBV screening should be considered in MSM, sex workers, injecting drug
users, HIV-positive patients, sexual assault victims, needle-stick victims
and sexual partners of positive or high-risk patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All pregnant women should also be tested for HBV during their first prenatal
visit and thereafter, if there is risk of infection from their regular
partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vaccination against
hepatitis B is recommended by the CDC for all infants, all children or
adolescents younger than 19 years of age who have not been vaccinated,
all adults aged 19 through 59 years, and adults aged 60 years or older
with risk factors for hepatitis B infection.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; All infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon
as possible after birth (within 24 hours). This is followed by two or three
doses of hepatitis B vaccine at least four weeks apart.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce the risk of
getting HBV:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual
activity&nbsp;</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the number of sex partners</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid sharing needles or any equipment used for injecting
drugs, piercing, or tattooing</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine use of standard precaution when handling blood or
bodily fluids</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>Partner notification should be performed and documented and the outcome
documented at the subsequent follow-up. Contact tracing should include
any sexual contact or needle-sharing partners during the period in which
the index case is thought to have been infectious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The infectious period is from 2 weeks before the onset of jaundice until
the patient becomes surface antigen negative. In cases of chronic infection
trace contacts as far back as any episode of jaundice or to the time when
the infection is thought to have been acquired, this may be impractical
for periods of longer than 2 or 3 years</p>
