2019 and quickly spread across the world. It was declared a global pandemic
on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In May 2023, WHO
declared that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency of international
concern. However, the virus continues to circulate in communities and remains
