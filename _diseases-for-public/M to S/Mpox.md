<summary><strong>What is Mpox?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox is a virus disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the
Orthopoxvirus. It can cause painful rashes, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is Mpox Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox is transmitted when a person comes into close contact with an infected
animal or human. The virus is transmitted through broken skin (visible
or not), the respiratory tract, or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose,
mouth, or genitals.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of Mpox?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptoms of mpox include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fever;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle ache;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backache;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lymphadenopathy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asthenia, or a general feeling of exhaustion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within one to three days after the onset of fever, infected people will
develop a rash, often starting from the face before spreading to the rest
of the body. Up to 75% of cases have rashes involving the palms and soles.
The lesions progress to become vesicles and then pustules. The pustules
then crust in approximately 10 days, which then spontaneously fall off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seek medical attention immediately if you develop symptoms such as sudden
onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash, and inform your doctor
of any recent travel or exposure history.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Risk Factors?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contact with infected animals, preparation, or consumption of bush meat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close contact with confirmed cases, including history of sexual or intimate
in-person contact with persons in a social or sexual network experiencing
mpox activity; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sexual partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How to Treat Mpox?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mpox typically clears spontaneously within two to four weeks. This means
no antiviral drugs are needed, and the treatment is primarily supportive.
This means getting rest, proper nutrition, and hydration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its highly infectious nature, patients with mpox are isolated.</p>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How to Prevent Mpox?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Ways to prevent Mpox include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Monitoring your health and maintaining a high standard of personal hygiene,
including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands
are soiled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding contact with persons who are unwell and objects that may have
become contaminated with infectious fluids such as soiled clothing, bedding,
or towels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sexual partners
or casual sex; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding contact with wild animals that could harbour the virus, and consumption
of bushmeat when travelling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also modified smallpox vaccinations that offer 80% protection
against mpox. However, population-wide vaccination is not recommended according
to international guidelines, due to its transmission being limited to close
or prolonged contact and mpox clearing spontaneously within four weeks.</p>
