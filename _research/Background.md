<p>​​​Singapore is one of the world’s most connected cities and thus vulnerable
to threats posed by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as well as endemic
infectious diseases such as dengue and the human immunodeficiency virus
infection.</p>
<p>Singapore has long been a regional leader in infectious diseases research
over the last 100 years or so including some of the pioneering studies
in tuberculosis treatment and polio vaccination. The recent <a href="https://www.nmrc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/about-us-library/idtf-summary-report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infectious Disease Taskforce (IDTF)</a> had
previously identified <strong>FIVE</strong> priority areas of research in
Singapore. They are:</p>
