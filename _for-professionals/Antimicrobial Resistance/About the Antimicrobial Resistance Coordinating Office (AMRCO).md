<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Antimicrobial Resistance Coordinating Office (AMRCO) was established
in September 2018 as a coordinating body to facilitate the implementation
and monitoring of the NSAP, coordinate AMR efforts across different sectors
and serve as secretariat for national committees.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Public education is a cornerstone in the fight against AMR. Raising awareness
and understanding of AMR will prevent the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials
and help to reduce the spread of infections. This, coupled with professional
education and training for healthcare professionals, will lead to individual-
and societal- level impact to the sustainable and responsible use of antimicrobials.</p>

<summary><strong>World AMR Awareness Week social media campaigns</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Held annually from 18 to 24 November, World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW)
aims to increase awareness of global AMR and encourage best practices among
the public, healthcare workers and policy makers to prevent further emergence
and spread of AMR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During WAAW, AMRCO regularly runs a campaign on NCID’s social media avenues
to highlight AMR as a global public health concern, what the public can
do to play their part, and why the One Health approach matters.</p>

<h3>Surveillance</h3>
<p>Surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial utilisation is essential to understand
the magnitude, distribution and impact of resistant organisms and antimicrobial
use. Regular monitoring of resistance trends, associations between usage
and resistance, and outcomes of policies and initiatives to combat AMR
will help enable a timely and appropriate response to AMR.</p>

<summary><strong>One Health Report on Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The two-yearly One Health Report on Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance
is a collaboration between MOH, NEA, NParks, PUB, SFA and AMRCO, NCID.
The multi-sectoral surveillance report provides an overview of national
surveillance programmes, including surveillance on the utilisation and
sales of antimicrobials in the human and animal health sectors, incidence
and resistance proportions (%R) of priority AMR organisms found in humans,
animals, food and the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It also presents key findings on antimicrobial utilisation and resistant
organisms in the human, animal, food and environmental sectors in Singapore.</p>

<p>In 2019, Singapore enrolled in the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance
and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), the first global collaborative effort
to standardise AMR surveillance. Singapore has been contributing AMR data
from sentinel healthcare facilities through AMRCO, which is the appointed
GLASS National Coordinating Centre.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Research helps fill in gaps in knowledge, improve our understanding of
the AMR situation and enhance tools and measures needed to help control
this complex problem. The AMRCO&nbsp;serves as the national body to coordinate
One Health AMR research across the human, animal, food and environment
sectors, and funding of One Health AMR research.</p>

<p>The One Health Antimicrobial Resistance Research Programme (OHARP) is
funded by the MOH, NEA, NParks, PUB, and SFA. NCID is the appointed grant
intermediary, providing grant administration and management support for
OHARP grants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OHARP supports One Health AMR research in the following research priority
areas - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP); Transmission Pathways;
and Socioeconomic Impact of AMR.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In addition to improving our understanding of resistance development,
it is also necessary to be informed of where the gaps in evidence lie so
that resources for research could be allocated appropriately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The review of the AMR research landscape in Singapore is conducted regularly
by AMRCO to understand the current research and innovations in this field.
This will provide information on current research trends and topics in
AMR, as well as the expertise in Singapore. The review will also identify
opportunities for research, with the goal of fostering collaborations among
scientists from different domains, especially across sectors, to develop
novel tools, strategies and methods to address AMR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first comprehensive review of AMR research articles published by Singapore’s
research community from 2009 to 2019 was completed. Findings derived from
the review provided important insights that is guiding our prioritisation
of One Health AMR research efforts. The charts below show information on
the trends of AMR research published, including both (A) an overall annual
trend and (B) the annual trend according to research domains, (C) the distribution
of research publications according to the research domains, (D) the research
publication by respective One Health sectors, (E) annual publication trend
from the One Health sectors, and (F) the distribution of institutional
research output in each of the research domains.</p>

<h3>Optimisation of Antimicrobial Use</h3>
<p>Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is the largest driver of AMR. Infections
with organisms resistant against last-line antimicrobials have already
been observed in patients in Singapore. Measures must therefore be taken
to conserve existing antimicrobials.</p>
<p>The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes promotes rational
prescribing practices, slows the emergence of resistance and reduces risks
to the healthcare system.</p>

<summary><strong>Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) have been implemented in all
public hospitals since 2011. This includes the establishment of ASP teams
consisting of infectious diseases physicians and ASP pharmacists. The tracking
of antimicrobial usage, appropriateness of antimicrobial use and ASP intervention
acceptance rates are reported regularly to hospital management and ASP
teams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Infectious Diseases Research and Training Office holds the Singapore
Antimicrobial Stewardship Training Course annually. It aims to empower
individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to establish and operationalise
effective ASPs.</p>

<summary><strong>National Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis Guideline (Singapore)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The National Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis (SAP) Guideline (Singapore)
provides evidence-based recommendations for the rational use of antibiotic
prophylaxis, including recommended agent(s), dose, timing and duration
for adult patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated surgeries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It aims to align best practices nationally and provide a framework for
audit and surveillance, so that the rate of surgical site infections and
adverse events from prolonged duration of surgical prophylaxis might be
reduced.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The guideline was developed through a multidisciplinary collaborative
effort by the National Antimicrobial Stewardship Expert Panel (NASEP) National
SAP Guideline Development Workgroup, comprising Infectious Disease (ID)
physicians, ID and/or antimicrobial stewardship-trained pharmacists, surgeons
and anaesthesiologists, and endorsed by NCID and the Chapter of ID Physicians,
College of Physicians, College of Anaesthesiologists and College of Surgeons
under the Academy of Medicine, Singapore.</p>
