<summary><strong>What is Zika?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Zika virus infection is primarily transmitted by the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito,
similar to dengue.</p>

<summary><strong>How is Zika Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans via the bite of an infective <em>Aedes</em> mosquito
(<em>Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus</em> are the common species found
locally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Infection
during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects, including microcephaly
(babyâ€™s head is much smaller than expected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexual transmission has also been reported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The incubation period is about 3 to 14 days.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of Zika?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Zika is generally a mild and self-limiting illness. Most people infected
with the Zika virus do not develop symptoms. One in five cases may present
with the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conjunctivitis (red eyes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms usually appear within 3 to 14 days of being bitten by an infected <em>Aedes</em> mosquito
and can last between 4 to 7 days.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Potential Complications of Zika?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Although rare, serious neurological complications and foetal abnormalities
have been associated with Zika virus infection. While there is currently
no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to get the Zika virus infection,
the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected, as
the Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly in a small number of unborn
foetuses.</p>
<p>Pregnant women with symptoms of possible Zika virus infection should seek
medical attention immediately and consult their Obstetrics and Gynaecology
(O&amp;G) doctor.</p>

<summary><strong>How is Zika Treated?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>For those who are not pregnant, confirming a Zika infection generally
does not have an impact on the clinical management, which is currently
focused on relieving symptoms. It is, however, useful in directing vector
control efforts.</p>
<p>Doctors will continue to make the clinical judgement on individuals as
to whether testing of Zika is necessary.</p>
<p>There is no specific treatment or vaccine for Zika virus infection. The
treatment is generally supportive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are not pregnant: </strong>your symptoms will be managed
as they present themselves. There is no specific anti-viral medication
to treat Zika virus infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are a man planning a pregnancy or your partner is already pregnant: </strong>You
should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms
or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least three months after recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are a woman planning a pregnancy: </strong>You should practise
safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or abstain
from sexual intercourse for at least two months after recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are pregnant: </strong>You should consult an O&amp;G doctor
so that your condition can be further managed.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent Zika?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Zika and everyone</strong>
</p>
<p>Preventing the breeding of the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito remains the most
effective way to control the spread of the Zika virus infection in Singapore.
You can proactively take measures to protect yourself, your family, and
your co-workers by removing stagnant water in and around your home and
workplace to prevent mosquito breeding.</p>
<p>You can also prevent mosquito bites by applying insect repellent, wearing
long, covered clothing and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with
wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes.</p>
<p><strong>During pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<p>If you, or your sexual partner, work, study or live in an affected area,
you should adopt safe sexual practices (e.g. consistent and correct use
of condoms during sex) or consider abstinence throughout your pregnancy.</p>
<p>If your sexual partner has tested positive for Zika, you should consult
your doctor and inform him/her of your possible exposure to Zika so that
he/she can arrange for you to be tested. Do keep in mind that World Health
Organization's May 2016 guidelines do not recommend routine Zika testing
for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss
further with your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>For couples planning pregnancy</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If both the man and woman are well: </strong>They should take
strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions,
consult their doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the woman is symptomatic </strong>(with fever, rash or other
symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain)<strong>: </strong>She should seek
medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, she should
practise safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual intercourse for
at least two months after recovery, before trying to conceive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the man is symptomatic </strong>(with fever, rash or other
symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain)<strong>:</strong> He should seek
medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, he should
practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or
abstain from sexual intercourse for at least three months after recovery.</p>
