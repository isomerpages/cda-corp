<p>The methodology used in scientometric analyses and visualization for grant
and research output of local infectious diseases research studies is summarized
in the flowchart above. We acknowledge the limitations of this approach
in that some articles, grants and publications will not be captured. Please
let us know if you are aware of any missing data and we can review those
data for possible inclusion.</p>
<p>A literature search was conducted with a detailed search strategy containing
infectious diseases keywords and their respective <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/meshtutorial/introduction/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)</a> using
the thesaurus from the MEDLINE database in “title, abstract and keywords”.
Only records, regardless of their document type (e.g., articles, reviews,
case reports), published in English language during the predetermined timeframe
and capturing an element of infectious diseases in Singapore were included.
The extracted publications were saved as full records with cited references.
Each article was further reviewed to be included for scientometric analyses
upon agreement by team members. Data processing and cleaning were performed
using multiple open source software: <a href="http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CiteSpace 5.5</a>,
<a href="https://gephi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gephi 0.9.2</a>, <a href="https://www.vosviewer.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VOSviewer 1.6.13</a> and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> for
analytical purposes.</p>
<p>The present research landscape mapping analyses the research grant distributions,
co-authorship patterns, countries, institutions, keywords in the prioritised
infectious diseases areas from the previous IDTF.</p>
