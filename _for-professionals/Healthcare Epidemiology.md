<p>Healthcare epidemiology is the core scientific basisfor monitoring healthcare-associated
infections(HAIs). Identifying and tracking HAIs allows healthcareproviders
and policy makers the opportunity tointroduce and reinforce Infection Prevention
andControl (IPC) activities and interventions. Prevention ofinfections
needs to be strategic with insight into thevulnerability of those at risk,
the scale of the problem(or potential problem) and the threat posed by
likelypathogens. Such agents include the well-known, thevaccine preventable,
novel emerging and multi-drugresistant organisms (MDROs).</p>

<h2>Infection Prevention, Control and Outreach Office</h2>
<p>The Infection Prevention, Control and Outreach Office (ICON) supports
the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the National Infection Prevention and Control
Programme and its strategies which comprises three key aspects:​</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Development of national guidelines and standards on issues related to
infection prevention and control (IPC);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management and control of disease outbreaks; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive efforts to achieve excellence in quality of care and low rates of
healthcare-associated infections (HAI) through continuous process improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ICON strengthens Singapore’s IPC capabilities by leveraging a multisectoral
and multidisciplinary approach. ICON does this through surveillance and
audits to monitor trends, measure the impact of interventions and provide
recommendations for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>In addition, ICON imparts IPC knowledge and best practices to the healthcare
facilities, external agencies and the broader community through regular
engagements, training programmes and development of guidance materials.
These engagements and initiatives are contextualised to stakeholders’ needs,
with the aim to enhance IPC standards for ground processes, bolstering
Singapore’s preparedness and response in the fight against infectious diseases.​</p>
<p>Through active participation in various international and regional platforms
such as the Global Infection Prevention Control (GIPC) Network, ICON also
contributes its expertise in the development of international guidelines
and facilitates implementation of global IPC priorities at the national
level.</p>
