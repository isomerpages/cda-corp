<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA virus in the family <em>Picornaviridae</em>.
HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease unlike hepatitis B or
C. Acute hepatitis usually presents as a self-limited illness; development
of fulminant hepatitis is rare.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Outbreaks have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM), linked
to oro-anal or digital rectal contact. Outbreaks have also been reported
amongst intravenous drug users, in institutions for people with learning
difficulties, and in contaminated batches of factor VIII.</p>
<p>In 2020, there were 26 laboratory confirmed acute HAV infections in Singapore.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission occurs via faeco-oral (via food, water, close personal contact)
route.</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>15–45 days</p>
<p>Infectious period:<strong> </strong>Patients are infectious for approximately
two weeks before and one week after the jaundice by the non-parenteral
routes but the virus can be found in the blood and stool until after the
serum amino transferase levels have peaked. In HIV positive patients, HAV
viraemia may continue for over 90 days.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most children and up to half of adults are asymptomatic or have mild non-specific
symptoms with little or no jaundice.</p>
<p>In more ‘typical’ cases, there are two phases of symptoms:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The prodromal illness:</strong> Flu-like symptoms (malaise, myalgia,
fatigue), often with right upper abdominal pain. This phase lasts for 3–10
days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Followed by Icteric Illness: Jaundice (hepatic and cholestatic) associated
with anorexia, nausea, fatigue, liver enlargement and tenderness, which
usually lasts for one to three weeks. It can persist for 12 or more weeks
in a minority of patients who have cholestatic symptoms (itching and deep
jaundice).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulminant hepatitis complicates approximately 0.4% of cases, and is more
common in patients who are already infected with chronic hepatitis B or
C. Chronic infection (more than six months) has only been reported in a
very small number of case-reports; overall mortality is less than 0.1%.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Anyone who has not been vaccinated or previously infected can get infected
with HAV. In areas where HAV endemicity is high, most infections occur
during early childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Poor sanitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of safe water;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in a household with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a sexual partner of someone with acute hepatitis A infection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of recreational drugs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex between men; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travelling to areas of high endemicity without being immunised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A diagnosis is confirmed by a positive serum Hepatitis A virus specific
IgM (HAV-IgM) that remains positive for six months or more.</p>
<p>HAV-IgG does not distinguish between current or past infection and may
remain positive for life. Antibody produced in response to HAV infection
persists for life and confers protection against reinfection.</p>
<p>Other tests include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Serum amino-transferases (AST or ALT); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bilirubin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ALP will usually be less than two times the normal upper limit, but higher
if there is cholestasis. PT prolongation by more than five seconds suggests
developing hepatic decompensation.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients should be advised to avoid handling food and unprotected sex
until they have become non-infectious. They should also be screened for
other STIs in cases of sexually acquired hepatitis or as needed.</p>
<p>Patients with acute HAV infection usually require only supportive care.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mild or moderate icteric hepatitis : Manage as an outpatient emphasizing
rest and oral hydration; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe icteric hepatitis: For patients with vomiting, dehydration, or
signs of hepatic decompensation (change in conscious level or personality),
consider admission to hospital.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Prevention of hepatitis A:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended by the US Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention (US CDC) for MSM, injecting drug users, and patients
with chronic liver disease. Post vaccination serologic testing is not recommended
because most persons respond to the vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hepatitis A single-antigen vaccine may be given up to 14 days after exposure
providing exposure was within the infectious period of the source case
(during the prodromal illness or first week of jaundice).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is increasing evidence that vaccine-induced immunity may be more
than 20 years and possibly lifelong, so no further booster doses is currently
recommended after the primary course in immunocompetent patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A combined hepatitis A+B vaccine given on the same schedule as the hepatitis
B vaccine has similar efficacy to the individual vaccines although early
immunity to hepatitis B may be impaired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<p>Partner notification should be performed for at-risk contacts (oral or
anal, digital or rectal and penetrative anal sex) within two weeks before
to one week after the onset of jaundice.</p>
