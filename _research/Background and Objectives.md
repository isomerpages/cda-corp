<p>Singapore is one of the world’s most connected cities and thus vulnerable
to threats posed by emerging communicable diseases as well as endemic infectious
diseases such as dengue and the human immunodeficiency virus infection.</p>
<p>Singapore has long been a regional leader in communicable diseases research
over the last 100 years or so including some of the pioneering studies
in tuberculosis treatment and polio vaccination. The recent <a href="https://www.nmrc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/about-us-library/idtf-summary-report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infectious Disease Taskforce (IDTF)</a> had
previously identified <strong>FIVE</strong> priority areas of research in
Singapore. They are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antimicrobial Resistance / Healthcare-Associated Infections (AMR &amp;
HAIs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector Borne Diseases (VBDs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Infectious Disease Research Coordinating Office (<strong>IDRCO</strong>)
carried out a horizon scanning on local communicable disease research landscape
from <strong>January 2015 to December&nbsp;2022</strong>&nbsp;to establish
an overview of communicable disease research and comprehensive source of
information in Singapore.</p>
