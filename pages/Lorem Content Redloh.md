<summary>Caution with food and water consumption</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Travellers’ diarrhoea is the most common infectious problem encountered
by travellers. Follow these tips for safe consumption of food and drink:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before eating. If
soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand gel (with at
least 60% alcohol).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink only bottled or boiled water (1 minute at full boil), or canned
drinks. Avoid tap water and ice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure food is well-cooked and at a hot temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not eat or drink unpasteurized dairy (milk) products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruits which can be peeled are safer. Avoid uncooked vegetables, including
salads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid food purchased from street vendors.</p>

<summary>Treatment with traveller's diarrhoea</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Diseases from food and water cause diarrhoea, vomiting, as well as fever
in severe cases. Most cases of travellers’ diarrhoea will improve after
2-3 days without needing antibiotics. Severe diarrhoea includes more than
5-10 loose stools per day, bloody stools or with fever.&nbsp;Treatment
consists of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Replacing fluids and electrolytes (salts and sugars) that are lost by
diarrhoea. Oral rehydration salts are available at most pharmacies – follow
package instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring all <strong>anti-diarrheal medicine </strong>with you so you can
treat mild cases yourself. Pepto-Bismol, <strong>Lomotil </strong>or <strong>Imodium </strong>can
be used to treat diarrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ciprofloxacin / Azithomycin (antibiotic available by doctor’s prescription).
Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for up to 3 days (or Azithromycin 1000mg
as a single dose) may be effective for treating severe traveller’s diarrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea (lasting more than 7 days),
it is advisable to seek medical attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Stool tests may be required to check for bacteria or parasites.</p>

<summary>Preventing animal bites and scratches</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Animal bites and scratches may cause wound infections or transmit rabies.
Humans who develop rabies uniformity die as a result. It is important to
understand how to reduce your risk, and what to do if you do get bitten
or scratched.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid feeding or touching animals, especially stray dogs. Even animals
that look healthy may have rabies or other diseases. Bats may transmit
rabies via close contact alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help children stay safe by supervising them when around animals, and instructing
them to report any animal bites/ scratches <strong><em>immediately</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>*** If you are bitten or scratched, wash the wound immediately with soap and water for 15 minutes.&nbsp; Call a doctor immediately for rabies post-exposure prevention. This consists of a series of 4-5 rabies vaccines, given over 21-28 days. If you have never had a rabies vaccine before, you may also need rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). RIG must be administered as soon as possible (but no later than 7 days after starting rabies vaccines).</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be sure to inform your doctor and/or state health department of any rabies
exposure.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary>Vaccine side effects</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Vaccinations you receive may cause pain, redness or swelling at the injection
site. Occasionally, fever, headache or muscle aches also occur. Most of
these side effects are mild, and resolve over 1-3 days. You may take paracetamol
to relieve these symptoms. If uncommon side effects occur (rash, fits,
numbness, weakness, etc.) please contact the Traveller’s Health and Vaccination
Clinic. We will assess and advise if you should avoid that vaccine in future.
If the reaction is serious (swelling of the lip, tongue or face, difficulty
breathing, loss of consciousness), please proceed to the nearest hospital
emergency room. If the reaction is serious and related to the vaccine,
we may also have to notify the health authorities.</p>
<h3><strong>Specific Vaccine Precautions</strong></h3>
<p>If you received MMR, Yellow Fever or Varicella (chickenpox) vaccines,
avoid pregnancy for 1-3 months.&nbsp; Persons who receive yellow fever
vaccine should avoid donating blood for 10 days.</p>

<summary>Malaria prevention</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Malaria is a serious illness, transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms
include fever, chills, headache (may be mistaken for “the flu” or “a stomach
virus”). In certain cases, death results within a few days. Malaria risks
vary in different countries (and in areas within the same country). If
you develop fever (&gt;38.3 C or &gt; 101F) during your visit in malarious
areas, or within 12 months such a visit, notify your doctor.</p>
<p>You can reduce your risk of catching malaria by using personal protective
measures.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use insect repellant containing DEET on exposed skin after dusk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing long pants and long-sleeved clothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using insecticide-treated bednets, or sleeping in a mosquito-free setting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-malaria medications can be used for prevention, and are usually 80-90%
effective.</p>

<summary>Altitude illness prevention</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Altitude illness refers to the symptoms experienced due to lower oxygen
pressure at higher altitudes, typically above 3000m. This can worsen to
severe acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)
or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). Be familiar with the symptoms of
these conditions prior to travel. You can reduce your risk of serious altitude
illness by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ascending gradually and allowing your body time to acclimatize</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being well hydrated and avoiding alcohol at high altitudes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediate, rapid descent if symptoms develop (urgent medical care for
severe disease)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diamox (accetazolamide) 250mg twice daily (or 125mg 4 times daily)<br>(Doctor’s prescription needed) </strong>starting
24 hours before ascent until return to lower altitude can help reduce altitude
illness. Avoid if allergic to sulfa drugs. (Dexamethasone 4mg 4 times daily
may be useful in immediate treatment of HAPE/ or HACE)</p>
