<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>GBS is a bacterium commonly found in the gut and urinary tract of adults,
without causing any disease i.e. non-invasive. However, in some adults,
GBS may occasionally cause invasive infections of the skin, joints, hearts
and brain. GBS can also cause blood infection in infants if acquired from
mothers during childbirth.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>GBS is distributed worldwide. Approximately 10-40% of the general population
can be asymptomatically colonised with GBS. Sites of colonisation are skin
and mucosal surfaces (including the oropharynx and lower gastrointestinal
tract), or genital tract. Colonisation rates vary by site, geographical
location and population demographics.</p>
<p>In Singapore, an outbreak of invasive GBS infections (Type III disease,
sequence type 283 strain) in mid-2015 was associated with consumption of
a particular Chinese-style freshwater raw-fish dish. Compared to non-ST283
GBS, patients with ST283 infection were younger and had fewer comorbidities
but were more likely to develop meningoencephalitis, septic arthritis,
and spinal infection. Culture of 43 fish samples yielded 13 ST283-positive
samples.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) or <em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em>
</p>
</div>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Asymptomatic carriage in gastrointestinal and genital tracts is common.
Pregnant women with vaginal colonisation of GBS (especially those who test
positive in later pregnancy, at 35-37 weeks gestation) risk transmission
to the foetus in utero or to the neonate during labour at time of delivery.
The rates of vertical transmission can be as high as 50% if intrapartum
antibiotic prophylaxis is not given before delivery.</p>
<p>Nosocomial transmission can occur but this is uncommon.</p>
<p>Incubation period: There is no defined incubation period for GBS acquisition
to infection in adults, however onset of disease is usually acute, within
days. For cases of mother-to-child transmission in neonatal infection,
incubation period is from 1-6 days (early onset disease), and between 7-90
days (late onset disease).</p>
<p>Infectious period: There is no clearly known infectious period for adults
with active GBS infections, however this is an important issue in mother-to-child
transmission.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>GBS can cause invasive disease (i.e. isolation of GBS from a normally
sterile site). In adults, primary bacteraemia accounts for up to 20-50%
of cases of first episode of infection – initial presentation may be varied,
and symptoms may be non-focal, including fever, chills, general malaise,
drowsiness or altered mental status. The most common focal site of infection
is the skin and soft tissues. Patients can present with cellulitis, abscesses,
and less commonly necrotising fasciitis. Other sites of GBS infection include
urinary tract infection, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis
and meningitis.</p>
<p>Common manifestations of neonatal infection are sepsis without a focal
source, pneumonia, and meningitis.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors for invasive GBS infection include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Infants born to mothers colonises with GBS,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People aged 65 years and older</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with underlying medical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic
liver, renal or pulmonary disease, malignancy, chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression,
cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who consume ready-to-eat raw freshwater fish</p>
</li>
</ul>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>GBS infection can be diagnosed when a culture detects GBS in a person’s
blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most isolates of GBS remain susceptible to penicillin and cephalosporin.
Penicillin is the usual drug of choice for treatment. However initial empirical
antibiotic choice should also be guided by local or hospital antibiotic
guidelines and susceptibility data. Duration of antibiotic treatment varies
depending on site and severity of infection.</p>
<p>It is also of utmost important to obtain adequate source control when
needed (e.g. surgical debridement or washout, or drainage of collections
or abscesses).</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Intrapartum GBS prophylaxis (usually penicillin) should be administered
to women colonised with GBS to reduce transmission and likelihood of neonatal
infection.</p>
<p>There are otherwise no known effective measures to prevent infection in
adults, unless in case of specific established epidemiological link during
an outbreak investigation.</p>

<summary><strong>Notification</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Although Group B streptococcal infection is not a notifiable disease,
all hospitals are required to report weekly number of patients with invasive
infection to MOH.</p>
