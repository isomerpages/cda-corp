<li>
<p>One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) definition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably
balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes
the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider
environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and inter-dependent.
The approach mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at
varying levels of society to work together to foster well-being and tackle
threats to health and ecosystems, while addressing the collective need
for clean water, energy and air, safe and nutritious food, taking action
on climate change, and contributing to sustainable development.</p>
<p>Central to this definition is taking One Health from theory to practice
through 4Cs: Communication, Coordination, Collaboration, and Capacity Building.
The approach is supported by four major international organisations, the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World
Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The concept of One Health is not new, as there has always been a need
for the human health, animal health and environmental health agencies to
work together to address cross-sectoral areas.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Key One Health Issues</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One Health encompasses a wide range of interconnected issues affecting
humans, animals, and the environment. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Zoonotic diseases: Both emerging and re-emerging, as well as those endemic
to the Southeast Asian region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne illnesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges to food safety and security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, at the global level:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Risk drivers such as climate change and international trade and travel
of people, animals and food supply contribute to expanding habitats for
disease vectors like mosquitoes, leading to an increase in associated illnesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zoonotic diseases can jeopardise food production, affecting livelihoods
and economic stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contaminated water sources used for consumption, leisure, and other purposes
pose health risks to both people and animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMR pathogens can spread rapidly through various channels, including communities,
food chains, healthcare settings, and the environment, complicating treatment
for both humans and animals <em>(For more information on Singapore’s National Strategic Action Plan on AMR, please refer to: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ncid.sg/About-NCID/OurDepartments/Antimicrobial-Resistance-Coordinating-Office/Pages/default.aspx</a>)</em>

<li>
<p>Rationale for One Health approach in Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore made early moves to adopt the One Health approach in 2012 to
safeguard human, animal, and environmental health. This early adoption
has enhanced surveillance, preparedness, and response programmes. Building
on this, Singapore is committed to strengthen the One Health approach,
emphasising early prevention and detection of health risks especially infectious
diseases, by working closely with local and international partners on One
Health initiatives.</p>
<p>The past outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and group B streptococcus (GBS) have
further emphasised the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious and
zoonotic diseases. Southeast Asia, including Singapore, is a hotspot for
emerging diseases. The region has faced numerous public health emergencies
and outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and Nipah virus. To address
these challenges effectively, a multidisciplinary One Health approach is
crucial. This approach aims to balance and optimise the health of humans,
animals, plants, and the environment in a sustainable manner.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore’s One Health framework and Establishment of One Health Office</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore’s One Health Framework, which comprise the Ministry of Health
(MOH), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), National Parks Board (NParks), National
Environment Agency (NEA) and PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, and
the One Health Office (OHO) established by the interim Communicable Diseases
Agency (CDA) under MOH work together on multisectoral collaborative initiatives
at the human-animal-environment interface to address public health concerns
and to prevent, prepare against, respond to, and learn from public health
threats.</p>
<p>The main body of One Health collaboration is the inter-agency One Health
Co-ordinating Committee (OHCC), which provides strategic direction and
sets priorities on One Health issues in Singapore. The OHCC champions inter-agency
coordination and collaboration on One Health issues, including the progress
and effectiveness of the One Health action plans. The OHCC comprises senior-level
representatives, ensuring high-level commitment and decision-making capacity.</p>
<p>The inter-agency One Health Working Group (OHWG) works under the direction
of the OHCC to formulate, coordinate, implement and review programmes,
initiatives, and action plans. Sub-working groups or project teams are
established as and when necessary, to focus on specific areas of One Health
issues.</p>
<p>The OHO serves as a coordinating secretariat for One Health initiatives
in Singapore. Its roles include acting as the primary point of contact
for external enquiries on One Health matters, facilitating inter-agency
collaboration, and supporting the implementation of One Health strategies
across relevant sectors.</p>

<summary><strong>Participation in international and regional One Health initiatives</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International One Health initiatives: Quadripartite
One Health Joint Plan of Action</p>
<p>To inform and drive One Health efforts at the global level, the Quadripartite
One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA) was published by the Quadripartite
- FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH, in collaboration with the One Health High-Level
Expert Panel (OHHLEP). The plan establishes five priority areas for One
Health: enhancing capacities to strengthen systems, reducing risks from
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic epidemics and pandemics, controlling
and eliminating endemic zoonotic, neglected tropical and vector-borne diseases,
curbing the silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and integrating
the environment into One Health.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Regional One Health initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore actively participates in One Health initiatives regionally and
internationally, notably leading ASEAN initiatives such as drafting guidelines
on antimicrobial use in livestock and co-hosting the World One Health Congress
in 2022. The ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on One Health Initiative, adopted
in May 2023, establishes the ASEAN One Health Network (AOHN), commits to
analysing One Health implementation, and develops the ASEAN One Health
Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA). The AOHN, launched in June 2024, aims to
strengthen multisectoral collaboration with key functions including identifying
priorities, facilitating knowledge exchange, and promoting One Health perspectives.
The OH-JPA outlines the implementation plan for the One Health approach
in ASEAN Member States. Its objectives include guiding the AOHN, serving
as a reference for national plans, and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
