<summary><strong>What is Genital Herpes?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) that affects men and women. The virus spreads primarily through
sexual contact. It does not spread through contact with objects used by
an infected person as the virus dies quickly outside the body.</p>
<p>There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections that can
cause genital herpes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HSV-1 often spreads through oral contact and causes infections in or around
the mouth (known as oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital
herpes.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HSV-2 often spreads through sexual contact and causes genital herpes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>How is Genital Herpes Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The primary mode of transmission of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is via direct
contact of open lesions. It can occur through genital to genital, mouth
to genital, genital to anal and mouth to anal contact. HSV-1 and HSV-2
can also be shed from normal-appearing skin or inner linings of oral or
genital cavities.</p>
<p>You cannot get genital herpes from objects such as cutlery or cups – the
virus dies very quickly when away from the skin.</p>

<p>Most people with HSV infection experience either no or mild symptoms.
Consequently, they may transmit the virus to their partners unknowingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes may either be primary or non-primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First-episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple
grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uncomplicated lesions take two to four weeks to heal. Complications may
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Aseptic meningitis; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomic neuropathy resulting in urinary retention and autoinoculation
to fingers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrent episodes are usually less severe. The vesicles or erosions develop
on a single site of the body and usually heal within 10 days. The median
recurrence rate is about once per year for HSV-1 and four per year for
HSV-2.&nbsp;</p>
