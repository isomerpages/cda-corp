<summary><strong>What is HAV?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver that causes inflammation.
It is caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV). Unlike Hepatitis B and C,
HAV does not cause chronic liver disease.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is HAV Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HAV is transmitted through contaminated food or drinks, or from close
person-to-person contact.</p>
</div>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of HAV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most children and up to half of adults who have HAV are asymptomatic or
have mild non-specific symptoms with little or no jaundice.</p>
<p>When symptoms show, they occur in two phases:</p>

<li>
<p>Jaundice associated with anorexia, nausea, fatigue, liver enlargement
and tenderness, which usually lasts for 1–3 weeks. It can persist for 12
or more weeks in a minority of patients who have itching and deep jaundice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>

<p>Anyone who has not been vaccinated or previously infected can get HAV.
In areas where HAV endemicity is high, most infections occur during early
childhood.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat HAV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Treating HAV is primarily supportive. This means getting rest, proper
nutrition, and hydration. In severe cases, hospitalisation can be considered.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How to Prevent HAV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Get vaccinated. There is increasing evidence that vaccine-induced immunity
may last more than 20 years or possibly lifelong, so no further booster
doses are currently recommended.</p>
<p>A combined hepatitis A and B vaccine can be given.</p>
