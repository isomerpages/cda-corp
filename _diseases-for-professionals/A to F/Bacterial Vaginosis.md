<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women characterized
by an imbalance of microorganisms in the vagina. In cases of BV, there
is a decrease in the number of normal hydrogen peroxide-producing <em>Lactobacillus </em>species
and an excessive growth of anaerobic bacteria, such as <em>Gardnerella spp.</em>,&nbsp;<em>Prevotella spp., Mobilincus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis, leading to an increase in pH from less than 4.5 to as high as 7.0.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>BV is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it does occur more commonly in sexually active women. </em>The
exact role of sexual transmission in the pathogenesis of BV vaginal dysbiosis
is unclear.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV is the most common vaginal infection found in women of reproductive
age and is estimated to occur in anywhere from 5 to 70% of women. Globally,
it is more commonly reported in low-resource settings and areas with limited
access to healthcare.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The organisms most commonly associated with BV are&nbsp;<em>G. vaginalis, Bacteroides spp, Prevotella</em> spp.,&nbsp;<em>Mobiluncus</em>&nbsp;spp<em>.,</em>  <em>Ureaplasma </em>urealyticum<em> </em>and&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma hominis.</em>

<summary><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV may be asymptomatic. Common symptoms include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>unusual vaginal discharge that is thin and grayish-white</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a fishy odour from the vagina, especially after sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>itching or irritation around the vagina</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>burning during urination</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>At times, BV will go away without treatment. However, if untreated it
can lead to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>problems in pregnancy (for example, spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery
for pregnant women with BV)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>higher risk of STIs and HIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pelvic inflammatory disease</p>

<summary><strong>Risk factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>

<li>
<p>receptive cunnilingus</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV is often diagnosed by the Amsel criteria, with at least three of the
four criteria should be present:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Thin homogenous vaginal discharge that coats the vaginal wall and vestibule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pH of vaginal fluid &gt; 4.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive amine (fish-like) odour test (“whiff test”) before or after addition
of 10% KOH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presence of clue cells on microscopy of vaginal discharge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients should be asked to avoid vaginal douching, use of shower gels,
antiseptic agents or shampoos in the bath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recommended regimens for BV:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Metronidazole&nbsp;400-</strong>500 mg orally 2 times/day for
5 to 7 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metronidazole 2g orally single dose or</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metronidazole gel 0.75%</strong>&nbsp;one full applicator (5 g)
intravaginally daily for 5 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clindamycin cream 2%</strong>&nbsp;one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally
at bedtime for 7 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Recommended regimens for BV in pregnancy:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Metronidazole&nbsp;400-</strong>500 mg orally 2 times/day for
7 days or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metronidazole 200mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days or</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clindamycin 300mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Follow-up is not necessary if symptoms resolve. For high-risk pregnant
women, a one-month follow-up visit is recommended to evaluate if treatment
is successful. Long-term maintenance regimens are not recommended.</p>
<p>Alternative regimen can be given for recurrent disease. Please refer to
