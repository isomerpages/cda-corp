<h2>Research Laboratory</h2>
<p>The Research Laboratory serves as a specialised facility to provide scientists
and researchers with laboratory space and equipment to conduct a variety
of scientific experiments. The Research Laboratory comprises four sections:</p>

and clinical management</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Virology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Virology section investigates and advances research on viral diseases
of public health importance to support policy decisions and improve healthcare.
It focuses on endemic viruses of significant disease burden, emerging viral
infectious diseases, and high consequence pathogens.</p>
<p>Activities include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Studies of contemporary viruses currently circulating in Singapore and
the region to ensure the effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characterise novel viruses and variants to understand pathogenicity, infectiousness
and response to treatment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Immunology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Immunology section aims to thoroughly characterise and understand the
cellular and humoral immune response to infection or vaccination and its
variation in different population cohorts.</p>
<p><em>Activities include:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Characterisation of immune response to vaccination or infection by serological/
immunological analysis of patient samples to determine correlations of
protection or population-level immunity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore variation in immune/disease response in different population cohorts
to understand determinants of disease protection and pathogenesis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnostic Evaluation</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Diagnostic evaluation section designs and/or validates new or existing
diagnostic assays based on different technologies (e.g. molecular assays,
rapid or point-of-care tests) for communicable diseases of public health
interest.</p>
<p><em>Activities include:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Evaluation of rapid/POCT kits near patient for outbreak pathogens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation of new diagnostic technologies for diseases of public health
interest (e.g. dengue/ mpox/ Covid-19)</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<hr>
<h2>PREPARE Laboratory</h2>
<p>The PREPARE Laboratory maintains pandemic response capabilities (isolation,
characterisation, development and validation of medical countermeasures)
to emerging viral pathogens of clinical importance, in partnership with
existing national virological and immunological expertise.</p>
<p>Objectives of PREPARE Laboratory:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Isolation, characterisation and sequencing of novel epidemic/pandemic
viruses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of viral inactivation methods for viral isolates and clinical
samples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing and validation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics in in-vitro
and in-vivo models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain competency and safe working procedures to conduct infectious
disease research in a high containment setting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>National Infectious Diseases Biorepository (NIDB)</h2>
<p>The National Infectious Diseases Biorepository (NIDB) is a national resource
for the systematic preservation of microbial specimens and associated materials
to support public health efforts, outbreak preparedness and ID research.</p>
<p>Objectives of NIDB:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop, maintain and serve as a custodian of a national repository
and reference collection of microbes (bacteria, viruses and fungi) of public
health importance and associated clinical specimens in Singapore under
the direction of MOH and the Director General of Health. This repository
will facilitate public health investigations and research as determined
by the appropriate approval platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate the study of microbes (genotypic and phenotypic characterisation
including resistance and virulence) to inform public health and infection
control efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support and encourage research in the development and validation of
new diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NIDB Framework</p>
<p>All collections will be subject to the applicable Singapore / international
laws and ethical frameworks, such as the Human Biomedical Research Act
(HBRA), Human Biomedical Research (Tissue Banking) (HBR (TB)), Personal
Data Protection Act (PDPA), Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA), Infectious
Diseases Act (IDA), Biological Agents and Toxins Act (BATA), ethics approval
by the relevant institutional review board(s) (IRBs), and inter-institutional
agreements, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two main collections housed under NIDB are the public health collection
and the clinical and research collection.</p>
<p><strong>Public health collection:</strong> Samples collected under the
Infectious Diseases Act will be overseen by the Public Health Oversight
Committee</p>
<p><strong>Clinical/ research collection:</strong> Samples deposited (e.g.
from clinical and research networks) for use by the general clinical and
scientific community in Singapore and abroad will be overseen by the NIDB
oversight committee.</p>
