<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Foodborne illness comprises of specific diseases (e.g. cholera, hepatitis
A) and food poisoning. Food poisoning results from ingestion of food contaminated
with chemicals (insecticides, methyl alcohol), micro-organisms (bacteria,
fungi, viruses, parasites, algae) or their toxins (e.g. ciguatera poisoning),
and natural toxins (e.g. puffer fish and poisonous mushrooms) but does
not include food allergies.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Food-borne illness is increasingly recognised as an important public health
issue in both developed and developing countries. In recent years, there
have been significant changes in global food production, processing, distribution
and preparation, which in turn contribute to the changes observed in the
epidemiology of foodborne pathogens and the nature of outbreaks (from locally
limited outbreaks to widespread transregional or international outbreaks).
Factors including the globalisation of food source, population demographics,
consumer behaviour, food hygiene practices, as well as enhanced surveillance
systems, influence the local epidemiology of food borne illness.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Common foodborne pathogens causing food poisoning include norovirus,<em> Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp. (non-typhoidal), Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli.</em>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Mode of transmission: See Table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incubation period: Depending on the pathogen and ingested dose, it can
vary from hours to days (see Table).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infectious period: If the infectious dose of the causative agent is low,
disease is generally not contagious but person-person transmission can
occur with poor personal hygiene and food handling practices via faecal-oral
transmission.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The majority of food-borne illness present with acute gastrointestinal
symptoms:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Vomiting</strong> (e.g. <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>B. cereus</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diarrhoea</strong> (e.g.<em> Salmonella</em> spp., <em>Campylobacter</em> spp.,
enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever</strong> may or may not be present. Usually absent if due
to organisms which elaborate a toxin e.g. <em>S. aureus</em>. The presence
of fever may suggest infection with invasive bacteria (e.g. <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em> or <em>Campylobacter</em>),
enteric viruses, or a cytotoxic organism such as <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some infections present with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea with
leucocytes or blood (e.g., <em>Salmonella</em> spp., <em>Shigella</em> spp., <em>C. jejuni</em>).</p>
<p>Post-infectious syndromes rarely occur e.g. Reiter’s syndrome after salmonellosis,
Guillain-Barré syndrome after campylobacteriosis, and haemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS) after infections with E. coli O157:H7 or other Shiga-toxin
producing <em>E. coli</em> (STEC).</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Appropriate specimens for laboratory confirmation vary depending on the
clinical and epidemiological features (e.g. food implicated), and the likely
aetiological agent. Specimens to be obtained include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Patient’s stools, vomitus and blood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food handlers’ hand, stool or nose cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents of public health importance may require further culture for confirmation.
Isolation of the organism from food is preferred when diagnosing&nbsp;<em>S. aureus&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>C. perfringens</em>,
as these bacteria are also part of the normal flora. If&nbsp;<em>E. coli&nbsp;</em>0157:H7
is suspected, the microbiology laboratory needs to be informed.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Rehydration (either oral or intravenous) remains the mainstay of therapy.
Most cases of food poisoning can be treated outpatient with oral rehydration
salts (ORS) and symptomatic treatment.</p>
<p>Patients with bloody diarrhoea, high fever and dehydration and failure
to retain fluids should be considered for admission. Anti-motility agents
should be avoided as they may cause dangerous paralytic ileus and abdominal
distension, especially in children and infants.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial agents are of no value in the management of viral gastroenteritis,
Staphylococcal, <em>C. perfringens</em>, or<em> B. cereus</em> food poisoning.
Food poisoning caused by <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em>, Shiga toxin-producing
or invasive <em>E. coli</em> or <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> are usually
self-limiting.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial therapy for people with infections attributed to <em>E. coli</em> O157
and other STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 should be avoided as this has
been associated with an increased risk of developing HUS. These patients
should also be evaluated expectantly for the development of HUS.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients infected with pathogens of high public health impact may be isolated
and staff should adhere to contact precautions.</p>
<p>The aim of investigations is to identify the source and contain/control
the outbreak.</p>
<p>Epidemiological investigations will be conducted to obtain information
on food history, onset of illness and symptoms. Microbiological (e.g. stool
samples from cases, food samples) and environmental investigations (e.g.
food preparation practices, environmental sanitation) are also conducted.
Implicated food handlers will be referred to the designated referral laboratory
for stool cultures.</p>

<summary><strong>Notification</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All food poisoning outbreaks should be notified to the Ministry of Health
to facilitate investigations (MD 131 or electronically via CD-LENS). In
the event of a suspected gastroenteritis incidents of public health concern,
MOH and the Singapore Food Agency will conduct joint investigations at
implicated establishments to identify the source and contain/control the
outbreak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All food poisoning/ illness is a legally notifiable disease in Singapore.</p>
