<p>The National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP), previously known as the Singapore
TB Elimination Programme (STEP), was launched by the Ministry of Health
(MOH) in 1997 to strengthen the national tuberculosis (TB) prevention and
care efforts in response to the then-decade-long stagnation in the country's
TB incidence rate. Read more about STEP <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2572427/pdf/12764518.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>

<p>The NTBP Registry administers the national TB notification registry and
the national Treatment Surveillance Module, which monitors the treatment
progress and outcome of all TB cases in the country.</p>
<p>As the clinical arm of NTBP, the National Tuberculosis Screening Centre
(NTBSC) is the national referral centre for TB evaluation and treatment.
It manages 80% of the country's TB cases, majority of whom are treated
under the Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).</p>
<p>NTBSC also manages the screening of close contacts in households, workplaces
and congregate settings (such as schools and prisons) for active and latent
TB disease, as well as provides preventive therapy for contacts found to
have latent TB infection.</p>
