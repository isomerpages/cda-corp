<summary><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused
by the herpes simplex virus (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HSV-1: often spreads through oral contact and causes infections in or
around the mouth (known as oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause
genital herpes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HSV-2: often spreads through sexual contact and causes genital herpes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over
time. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, but an
increasing proportion has been attributed to HSV-1 infection, especially
among men who have sex with men (MSM) and young women. It is treatable
but not curable.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>According to the 2016 data from the World Health Organization, approximately
67% of the global population under the age of 50 had HSV-1 infection (oral
or genital), with the majority of these infections acquired during childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Genital herpes, caused by HSV-2, affects an estimated 13% of people aged
15-49 worldwide. HSV-2 infections are more common in women than in men,
attributed to the higher efficiency of sexual transmission from men to
women. Although the prevalence of HSV-2 increases with age, the majority
of new infections occur among adolescents.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The primary mode of transmission of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is via direct
contact of open lesions. It can occur through genital to genital, mouth
to genital, genital to anal and mouth to anal contact. HSV-1 and HSV-2
can also be shed from normal-appearing oral or genital mucosa or skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period: </strong>2 to 14 days</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Primary genital lesions are infective
for 7-10days, while those with recurrent disease may be infective for 4-7
days with each episode. Cold sores may be infective for up to 7 weeks after
recovery from stomatitis. &nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most individuals with HSV infection experience either no symptoms or only
mild symptoms. Consequently, they may transmit the virus to their partners
unknowingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes may either be primary or non-primary. Primary
genital herpes is defined as infection occurring in persons with no prior
exposure to either HSV type 1 or 2. Non-primary genital herpes is defined
as the first-genital episode in persons who have evidence of prior HSV
infection at another body site with either HSV type 1 or 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First-episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple
grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Females: lesions occur on the vulva, vagina and cervix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males: lesions occur mainly on the prepuce and sub-preputial areas of
the penis</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Healing of uncomplicated lesions take 2 to 4 weeks. Complications may
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Aseptic meningitis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomic neuropathy resulting in urinary retention and autoinoculation
to fingers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recurrent attacks are usually less severe than the first episode. The
vesicles or erosions develop on a single anatomical site and these usually
heal within 10 days. Median recurrence rate is approximately four recurrences
per year for HSV-2 and is four times more frequent than the recurrence
rate for HSV-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HSV is a significant cause of proctitis in MSM, more commonly found in
HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM. Only 32% of MSM with HSV-associated
proctitis had visible external anal ulceration.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexual contact with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging in unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past history or current presence of other STIs</p>
</li>
</ul>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited,
recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated
with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Tests for clinical diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nucleic acid-based amplification testing (NAAT) as the preferred method
for genital herpes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the test of choice for diagnosing HSV
infections affecting the central nervous system and systemic infections
(e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type-specific serologic tests (TSSTs) can be used to aid in the diagnosis
of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serology may be useful in certain clinical situations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Recurrent genital symptoms or atypical symptoms with negative HSV PCR
or culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asymptomatic partners of serodiscordant couples of genital herpes, including
women who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STI evaluation for persons with multiple sexual partners, persons with
HIV infection and MSM at increased risk for HIV acquisition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnant women presenting with first episode of genital herpes in the
third trimester</p>
</li>
</ul>
