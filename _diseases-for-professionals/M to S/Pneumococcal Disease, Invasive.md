<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined as the isolation of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>from
normally sterile sites such as blood, pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Pneumococcal disease occurs worldwide. <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is one of
the most common causes of invasive infections such as bacteraemia and meningitis.
The highest risk is in young children, the elderly and those with chronic
illness or immunosuppression. The number of identified serotypes is increasing
although most infections is still caused by a few serotypes.</p>
<p>The main serotypes have been incorporated into multivalent pneumococcal
vaccines. The worldwide emergence of pneumococcal resistance to antibiotics
is of concern, as is the replacement of vaccine serotypes by the emergence
of non-vaccine serotypes. Pneumococcal vaccination is included in the immunisation
schedule for both children and adults.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The causative agent is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>IPD is transmitted via droplet spread as well as direct and indirect contact
with respiratory secretions of an infected person, but usually requires
frequent or prolonged close contact.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period: </strong>Typically, 1-3 days. Uncertainty exists
as invasive disease progresses from an asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier
state after a variable duration</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Presumably infectious as long as pneumococci
are carried in oro-nasal secretions. With antimicrobial treatment, persons
infected with susceptible strains are rendered non-infectious within 24-48
hours.</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Infection is often preceded by a respiratory viral illness before local
disease (from congestion and concentration of virulent pneumococci) or
invasion leading to systemic or invasive disease that can potentially involve
any organ. Clinical manifestations depend on the site of infection. Common
clinical syndromes include meningitis and bacteraemia. Pneumococcal pneumonia
is not considered an invasive disease unless blood or pleural fluid cultures
are positive for the organism. Otitis media is not considered an invasive
disease, but may be included if <em>S. pneumoniae </em>is isolated from
normally sterile middle ear fluid.</p>
<p>Less commonly, IPD can also present as osteomyelitis, pyogenic arthritis,
endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, bacterial peritonitis, endophthalmitis
and salpingitis.</p>
<p>In immunocompromised patients, infections may be fulminant and present
with overwhelming sepsis and multiorgan failure.</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>IPD is diagnosed when <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is isolated from a normally
sterile body site e.g. blood, and CSF and pleural fluid.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients will require hospitalisation. Appropriate antibiotics should
be given. Empirical antibiotics should be guided by local guidelines before
adjusting according to microbiological and susceptibility test results.
Source control (e.g. drainage of abscesses) is often critical.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard precautions apply in the healthcare settings.</p>
<p>Under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, children &lt;1 year
old should receive 2 primary doses at 4 months and 6 months followed by
a booster at 12 months. Children aged 1 to 5 years with incomplete vaccination
should be given catch-up vaccination - the catch-up number of doses and
intervals between doses will depend on the child’s age when vaccination
begins.</p>
<p>All adults ≥65 years old are recommended to receive 1 dose each of PCV13
and PPSV23. Under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule, adults who
are immunocompromised or with other medical conditions such as cochlear
implants, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, anatomic or functional asplenia, are
recommended to receive one dose of PCV13, a first dose of PPSV23 at least
8 weeks after PCV13, and a second dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after
the first dose of PPSV23. Adults ≥18 years old with chronic conditions
such as chronic lung, heart, kidney or liver and diabetes mellitus are
recommended to receive PPSV23 or PCV13 depending on the specific condition.</p>
