<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.
It primarily affects the lungs, although it can also spread to other parts
of the body. While treatable and curable, TB remains a significant public
health concern globally.</p>

<p><strong>Global</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>TB is the second leading infectious killer worldwide, after COVID-19,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with TB, with 1.3 million
deaths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been &nbsp;infected
with TB bacteria (also known as latent TB infection), though not everyone
develops the active TB disease.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Local</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In 2023, there were 1,201 new cases of active TB disease among Singapore
residents. This is lower than the 1,251 cases in 2022. The incidence rate
was 28.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2023, compared to 30.4 cases per
100,000 in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TB is endemic in Singapore, and latent TB infection is not uncommon in
our population.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is an air-borne disease and is transmitted through close and prolonged
exposure to an infectious individual with untreated, active pulmonary (lung)
TB disease. Not all individuals who are exposed to an infectious individual
will get TB.</p>

<p><strong>Incubation period</strong>: 2 - 8 weeks, but can be much longer
(years)</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>Individuals with active TB disease
are infectious until they have completed effective treatment.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Diagnosis of active TB disease involves various methods, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chest X-ray</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sputum culture and microscopy</p>
</li>
<li>
