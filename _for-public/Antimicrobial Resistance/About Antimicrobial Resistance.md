<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top 10 global public health
threats facing humanity. Combatting AMR requires a collective effort from
society, including the general public, healthcare professionals and authorities.</p>
<h3>What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?</h3>
<p>Antimicrobials is the collective term for medicines that are used to prevent
and treat infections in humans, animals and plants. These medicines include
antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics for bacteria, viruses,
fungi and parasites, respectively.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) develops when microorganisms, such as bacteria,
fungi, viruses and parasites, are exposed to antimicrobials and, in order
to protect themselves against antimicrobials, undergo changes that prevent
these medicines from working effectively against them.</p>

<summary><strong>Why is AMR a Concern?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As a result of developing resistance, antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms
no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. This makes the infections
they cause harder to treat, increasing the risk of more severe illness
and even death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms emerging and spreading globally,
AMR threatens our ability to prevent and treat an ever-increasing range
of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. Without
effective antimicrobials for prevention and treatment of infections, medical
procedures (from transplants, chemotherapy to surgeries) can become life-threatening.
Around the world, healthcare systems are increasingly being put at risk.</p>

<summary><strong>When are Antibiotics Required?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Antibiotics kill or slow down the growth of bacteria.</p>
<p>Hence, they are used to treat bacterial infections, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Strep throat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whooping cough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuberculosis</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>However, antibiotics are not required for viral infections because they <strong>DO NOT</strong> work
on viruses. Common viral infections include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Flu (Influenza)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common cold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID-19</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HFMD (Hand Foot Mouth Disease)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>When you are down with the common cold or flu, you should:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Get plenty of rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay hydrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice good hygiene habits to prevent the infection from spreading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult your doctor if you do not get better</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Viral symptoms usually go away with time and symptomatic relief.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When your doctor prescribes antibiotics to treat your infection, the benefits
outweigh the risks. However, side effects may occur as antibiotics destroy
both good and bad bacteria. Common side effects include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diarrhoea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Your doctor may then prescribe probiotic tablets along with your antibiotic
to maintain and restore good bacteria. If you start developing other symptoms
like allergic skin rashes due to the antibiotic or/and your side effects
become worrisome, you should consult a doctor immediately.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Consequences of Misusing Antibiotics?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. This
reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infections when they
are really needed. This can lead to undesirable consequences:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Drug-resistant bugs</strong>
</p>
<p>Bacteria in the body become resistant to antibiotics – developing the
ability to resist the drugs designed to kill them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Increased medical costs</strong>
</p>
<p>Complications caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria can increase the
length of hospital stay and the cost of medical care.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Increased health risks</strong>
</p>
<p>Without antibiotics that work, illnesses caused by antibiotic-resistant
bacteria are harder or impossible to treat, and can lead to disability
and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If left unchecked, it is projected that antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
could cause as many as 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 - which is higher
than death attributed to diabetes (1.5 million) and cancer (8.2 million).</p>

<summary><strong>How Can You Protect Yourself and Your Loved Ones From Infections?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>An infection occurs when the invading microorganisms overcome the body’s
immune defences. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms
are harder to treat as the usual antimicrobials may not work. Instead,
stronger antimicrobials must be used, which may be more expensive and lead
to further resistance.</p>
<p>We can all act by protecting yourself and your loved ones against infections
with these simple steps:</p>

<p><strong>Practice good hygiene habits</strong>
</p>
<p>Our hands are in contact with germs, and we use our hands in our daily
routine such as eating. Animals are also capable of carrying germs which
can cause sickness in humans, and vice versa. Thus, regular hand washing
with soap for at least 20 seconds is one of the easiest and most effective
ways to get rid of germs, prevent infection and preventing germs from spreading
to others.</p>

<p><strong>Reduce infections</strong>
</p>
<p>Stay home, do not go to work or school if you are unwell. This helps to

<p>If you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough, wear a mask when you
are around others. Remember to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>If you have a wound and abrasion, make sure they are disinfected and covered
to prevent further infection.</p>

<p><strong>Take antibiotics responsibly</strong>
</p>
<p>Not all illnesses require antibiotics. For instance, antibiotics do not
treat viral infections such as the cold, flu and most upper respiratory
tract infections.</p>
<p><strong>Follow your doctor's advice for medication:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not demand for antibiotics from your doctor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor</p>

<li>
<p>Follow the recommended dosage and duration of treatment prescribed by
your doctor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never share antibiotics with others or use leftover antibiotics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never save antibiotics for later use</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practice food safety</strong>

<p>Proper food handling and cooking can reduce the risk of infection by harmful
microorganisms. The risk of foodborne illnesses can be mitigated by ensuring
good hand hygiene, washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cooking
or consuming, and cooking food thoroughly to eliminate harmful bacteria.</p>

practices.</p>
