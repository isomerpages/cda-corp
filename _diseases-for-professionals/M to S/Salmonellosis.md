<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Salmonella is a type of bacteria and a leading cause of food-borne illnesses
worldwide. It is naturally present in the intestines of animals and can
be found on food such as raw meat, raw dairy products, poultry and eggs.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Salmonella is a major cause of diarrhoeal disease and outbreaks in restaurants,
schools, and institutional settings result from inadequately cooked food
contaminated at source, from cross-contamination between ready-to-eat and
raw foods, or from an unhygienic infected food handler. Infections can
also result from direct contact with infected animals or their environments.
Poultry has been implicated in many outbreaks.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes, most commonly Typhimurium and
Enteritidis</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Usually occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, including
raw and undercooked food (e.g. milk, meat, poultry, egg products).</p>
<p>Person-to-person transmission through the faecal-oral route can also occur,
especially when diarrhoea is present. Zoonotic transmission from contact
with infected animals (e.g. live poultry, reptiles) has been reported as
well.</p>
<p>Incubation period: Typically, 12-36 hours; range is 6-72 hours</p>
<p>Infectious period: Throughout the course of infection and carriage. Patients
can have asymptomatic viral shedding of the organism for a median duration
after infection of 5 weeks in adults and 7 weeks in children &lt;5 years
of age.</p>
<p>Some individuals can develop chronic carriage and shed the organism for
more than a year after acute infection.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Salmonellosis presents with symptoms that include fever, diarrhoea, vomiting,
and abdominal cramps. While most cases of salmonellosis are mild, severity
depends on host factors and the serotype.</p>
<p>Complications include dehydration, and under 10% of patients develop invasive
infections (e.g. bacteraemia, mycotic aneurysm, focal infections such as
meningitis, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). At-risk individuals are
the young, elderly and immunocompromised patients with HIV, organ transplant,
or immunosuppressive therapy.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consumption of inadequately cooked food or food prepared by infected food
handler.</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella is diagnosed when
culture detects Salmonella bacteria in a person’s stool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invasive Salmonella infection is diagnosed when culture detects Salmonella
bacteria in a person’s blood, sterile fluids or tissues.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For uncomplicated gastroenteritis, no treatment is required except ensuring
adequate hydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In high-risk individuals at risk of invasive disease and in those with
severe disease, antibiotics are indicated. Appropriate antibiotic choices
include fluoroquinolones such as PO ciprofloxacin, PO trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
PO azithromycin or IV ceftriaxone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration of therapy for immunocompetent with non-bacteraemic Salmonella
infection is 3 – 7 days. In immunocompromised individuals with salmonellosis,
a longer duration of therapy up to 14 days or longer is recommended to
prevent relapse.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard and contact precautions (if active diarrhoea) apply in the healthcare
setting. There is no available vaccine.</p>
<p>Preventive measures include avoiding food and drinks at high risk of contamination,
good hand hygiene and proper food handling practices.</p>
<p>When an outbreak of foodborne illness is suspected, the aim of investigations
is to identify the source and contain/control the outbreak. Epidemiological
investigations will be conducted to obtain information on food history,
onset of illness and symptoms.</p>
<p>Microbiological (e.g. stool samples from cases, food samples) and environmental
investigations (e.g. food preparation practices, environmental sanitation)
are also conducted. Implicated food handlers will be referred to the designated
referral laboratory for stool cultures.</p>
