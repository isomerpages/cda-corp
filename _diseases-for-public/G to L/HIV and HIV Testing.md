<summary><strong>What is HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that weakens your body’s
immune system by destroying CD4 (T-cell) lymphocytes. It is spread through
bodily fluids like breast milk, blood, semen, or vaginal discharge from
a person living with HIV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people contract HIV through unprotected sex, sharing or using unsanitised
drug equipment like needles, or not taking medication to prevent or treat
HIV. If untreated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&nbsp;</p>

<summary><strong>What is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced stage of HIV
infection, causing your immune system to be severely weakened. You receive
an AIDS diagnosis when:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of your CD4
cell count.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, a healthy CD4 cell count is above 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<summary><strong>How is HIV Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV is transmitted through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected vaginal or anal sex with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing of contaminated needles and sharps;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infected women transmitting HIV to their baby during pregnancy, birth,
or breastfeeding; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact with infected blood and blood products (e.g. organs, plasma).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>HIV does not spread via:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Shaking hands, hugging, or touching;</p>

<li>
<p>Saliva, tears, or sweat;</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of HIV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HIV infection progresses through four different stages:</p>
<p><strong><u>Seroconversion Illness/Acute Retroviral Syndrome&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This stage is characterised by flu-like symptoms like fever, swelling
of the lymph nodes, rash, sore throat, muscle pain, diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting, headache, weight loss, or oral thrush. Some individuals may have
oral and genital ulcerations and neurological illnesses like aseptic meningitis.
The symptoms usually resolve on their own in most patients. The median
duration is 20 days, but it could range from less than a week to three
months.</p>
<p><strong><u>Asymptomatic (“Latent”) Disease</u></strong>
</p>
<p>There are no specific symptoms or signs in this stage, but the virus is
actively replicating and destroying the immune system by reducing CD4 cell
count. Swollen lymph nodes, which are often not noticed by the patient,
are usually present.</p>
<p><strong><u>Symptomatic Disease</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This stage presents more obvious symptoms such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fever;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swollen lymph nodes;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin and oral conditions (such as oral thrush, hairy leukoplakia, herpes
zoster, recurrent herpes simplex); and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunological conditions (such as having . idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura, multiple drug allergies).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>AIDS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The last stage of infection is characterised by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your CD4 cell count falling below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing one or more opportunistic infections regardless of your CD4
cell count.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunistic infections include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Viral: Persistent HSV ulceration for more than 1 month; CMV retinitis
or diseases involving body parts other than the liver, spleen, or lymph
nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bacterial: Tuberculosis (especially extrapulmonary); atypical mycobacteria
infections; recurrent bacterial pneumonia (2 or more episodes in 1 year);
recurrent non-typhoid-salmonella septicaemia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fungi: Oesophageal candidiasis; cryptococcal meningitis; histoplasmosis
(extra-pulmonary); pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protozoa: Cerebral toxoplasmosis; cryptosporidial diarrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selected tumours: Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; CNS lymphoma; Kaposi’s sarcoma;
cervical cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others: Wasting; dementia; progressive multi-focal leucoencepholopathy.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Test for HIV?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Getting tested for HIV is the only way to know your status. Delaying detection
and diagnosis could lead to poorer prognosis and treatment outcomes, increasing
the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>In Singapore, HIV testing is typically performed in hospitals, clinics,
and community-based organisations. Some clinics provide anonymous or rapid
testing services, where the latter can provide results in 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use HIV self-test kits. They can be purchased under the HIV
self-testing pilot programme at the Department of Sexually Transmitted
Infections Control (DSC) Clinic and Action for AIDS (AfA) Anonymous Test
Site (ATS).&nbsp;</p>
