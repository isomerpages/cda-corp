<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Melioidosis is caused by the environmental bacterium <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei. </em>Infection
typically occurs through direct contact with contaminated soil or water
via subcutaneous inoculation, ingestion, or inhalation. Melioidosis may
present as a localized infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, or disseminated
infection.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The disease is endemic to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where <em>B. pseudomallei </em>is
found in soil and surface water. Cases have been reported in Singapore
and elsewhere in Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean and the
Middle East.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission of Melioidosis occurs through direct inoculation of contaminated
soil or water through small cuts or abrasions, inhalation of contaminated
soil dust, or through ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Typically 9 days; range is 1-21 days.
May remain latent for months to years before symptoms develop.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Not considered contagious; person-to-person
spread is extremely rare.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The presentation of Melioidosis is variable and can mimic many other conditions
(e.g. tuberculosis). Melioidosis infections can be subclinical. Common
presentations include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pneumonia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>localised skin ulcers or abscesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>osteomyelitis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meningoencephalitis</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be considered as a differential in a patient presenting
with visceral abscesses (e.g. liver, spleen, kidney, prostate). Patients
are often bacteraemic and can develop a fulminant infection with septic
shock. The mortality rate is high in these cases. Some patients may present
with a relapse even after appropriate antibiotic therapy for the initial
episode of infection.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Occupational (e.g. military, farming, construction work), recreational
(e.g. adventure travellers) or other contact with soil or surface water
is a risk factor.</p>
<p>Those with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic
renal disease and chronic lung disease, are recognised to be at increased
risk of the disease.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Melioidosis is diagnosed when a laboratory test detects <em>B. pseudomallei</em> in
samples from blood, sputum, throat swabs, wound specimens, urine or fluid
obtained from infected site via<em> </em>PCR or bacterial culture.</p>
<p>Serology (e.g. indirect haemagglutination test) is not a reliable method
of diagnosis.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Patients require long courses of antibiotics. In the initial intensive
phase of therapy, intravenous antibiotics (ceftazidime or meropenem) are
given for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<p>This is followed by oral eradication therapy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
for 3-6 months. In the presence of intolerance or contraindication, amoxicillin-clavulanate
is a less effective oral alternative (ensure dosing is adequate). Abscesses
should be drained when possible.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard precautions apply in the healthcare setting.</p>
<p>Patients with known risk factors should cover all cuts and minimise contact
with soil and surface water. Protective clothing (gloves and boots) is
recommended for those with occupational exposure to soil and water. In
endemic areas, skin wounds that have become contaminated with soil or surface
water should be immediately and</p>
<p>thoroughly cleaned.</p>
<p>There is no available vaccine for Melioidosis.</p>
