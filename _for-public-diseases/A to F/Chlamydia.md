<summary>What is Chlamydia?&nbsp;&nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Chlamydia is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which can
be transmitted via vaginal, anal or oral sexual intercourse. Known as a
silent disease, early symptoms of Chlamydia often go unnoticed. Left untreated,
Chlamydia can seriously damage the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Any sexually active person may get infected through contact with mucous
membranes of the vagina, urethra, rectum or mouth. An infected mother can
also pass Chlamydia on to her baby during vaginal delivery.</p>
<p>The risk of infection increases with unprotected sex, multiple sexual
partners and those who engage in oral or anal sex. Teenage girls and young
women are more prone to Chlamydia infection as the opening of the uterus
(cervix) is not fully matured; this also increases their risk of developing
other STIs such as Gonorrhoea and Syphilis.</p>

<summary>How is Chlamydia transmitted?&nbsp;&nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Chlamydia bacteria are usually spread through sex or contact with
infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid).</p>
<p>
<br>You can get Chlamydia through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing sex toys that are not washed or covered with a new condom each
time they are used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals â€“ this
means you can get Chlamydia even if there is no penetration, orgasm or
ejaculation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chlamydia can also be passed on by a <strong>pregnant</strong> woman to
her baby.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chlamydia cannot be spread through casual contact, such as kissing and
hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or
cutlery.</p>

<summary>How do I know if I have Chlamydia?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptoms of early infection often go unnoticed or fail to appear. Hence,
Chlamydia is known as a silent disease. When symptoms do occur, they are
usually mild and start to show from <strong>1 - 3 weeks</strong> after exposure
to the bacteria.</p>
<p>Symptoms include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Burning sensation or pain while urinating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower abdominal or back pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rectal pain and discharge (anal sex)</p>

<p>A type of&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;can cause another STI
called <strong>Lymphogranuloma Venereum</strong>. The symptoms of this infection
include genital sores followed by fever and swelling of the lymph nodes
in the groin.</p>

<p>Untreated Chlamydia infections may progress to serious damage of the reproductive
organs along with other health problems.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Chlamydia may cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/pid/stdfact-pid.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</a> in
up to 4 out of 10 women without any symptoms. PID may result in chronic
pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus)
due to permanent scarring of the fallopian tubes. Women infected with Chlamydia
are up to 5 times more at risk of acquiring <strong>HIV</strong> Infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infection during <strong>pregnancy</strong> can result in premature delivery
and stillbirth. An infected mother can pass on the infection to her baby
during vaginal delivery, resulting in pneumonia (lung infection) or conjunctivitis
(eye infection).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chlamydia complications and infection may spread to the <strong>rectum</strong> and
result in inflammation, discharge&nbsp;and pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some individuals, severe <strong>conjunctivitis</strong> (eye infection)
may occur if the eyes become contaminated with infectious secretions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though rare, infection can spread to the <strong>epididymis</strong> (tube
carrying sperm from the testes) resulting in fever, scrotal pain, swelling&nbsp;and
sterility in men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very rarely, Chlamydial infection may cause inflammation of the joints
(<strong>arthritis</strong>) accompanied by lesions on the skin and inflammation
of the eye and urethra (Reiter's syndrome).</p>

<summary>How to treat Chlamydia</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Chlamydia can be effectively treated with <strong>antibiotics</strong>.
A single dose of oral Azithromycin or Doxycycline twice daily for one week
is the most common treatment. An alternative drug (erythromycin) may be
prescribed for those who are pregnant or younger than 18 years of age.</p>
<p>The infection usually resolves within <strong>1 - 2 weeks</strong>. Re-testing
after treatment should still be considered if you have a new sex partner&nbsp;or
are unsure of their treatment status.</p>

<summary>How to prevent Chlamydia</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The best way to prevent infection is to abstain from unprotected sex and
be faithful to your partner.</p>
<p>Other ways to reduce the risk of transmission:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use condoms consistently and correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from having sex until the infection is completely cured.</p>
</li>
<li>
