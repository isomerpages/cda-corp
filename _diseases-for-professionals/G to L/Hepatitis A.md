<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA virus in the family <em>Picornaviridae</em>.
HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease unlike hepatitis B or
C. Acute hepatitis usually presents as a self-limited illness; development
of fulminant hepatitis is rare.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Outbreaks have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM), linked
to oro-anal or digital rectal contact. Outbreaks have also been reported
amongst intravenous drug users, in institutions for people with learning
difficulties, and in contaminated batches of factor VIII.</p>
<p>In 2020, there were 26 laboratory confirmed acute HAV infections in Singapore.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission occurs via faeco-oral (via food, water, close personal contact)
route.</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>15–45 days</p>
<p>Infectious period:<strong> </strong>Patients are infectious for approximately
two weeks before and one week after the jaundice by the non-parenteral
routes but the virus can be found in the blood and stool until after the
serum amino transferase levels have peaked. In HIV positive patients, HAV
viraemia may continue for over 90 days.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most children and up to half of adults are asymptomatic or have mild non-specific
symptoms with little or no jaundice.</p>
<p>In more ‘typical’ cases, there are two phases of symptoms:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The prodromal illness:</strong> Flu-like symptoms (malaise, myalgia,
fatigue), often with right upper abdominal pain. This phase lasts for 3–10
days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Followed by Icteric Illness: Jaundice (hepatic and cholestatic) associated
with anorexia, nausea, fatigue, liver enlargement and tenderness, which
usually lasts for one to three weeks. It can persist for 12 or more weeks
in a minority of patients who have cholestatic symptoms (itching and deep
jaundice).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulminant hepatitis complicates approximately 0.4% of cases, and is more
common in patients who are already infected with chronic hepatitis B or
C. Chronic infection (more than six months) has only been reported in a
very small number of case-reports; overall mortality is less than 0.1%.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Anyone who has not been vaccinated or previously infected can get infected
with HAV. In areas where HAV endemicity is high, most infections occur
during early childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Poor sanitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of safe water;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in a household with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a sexual partner of someone with acute hepatitis A infection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of recreational drugs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex between men; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travelling to areas of high endemicity without being immunised.</p>
</li>
