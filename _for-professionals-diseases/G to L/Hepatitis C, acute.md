<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis C
virus (HCV). HCV is an RNA virus in the <em>Flaviviridae </em>family. HCV
infection may result in acute hepatitis, but may also be asymptomatic.
A significant proportion of patients develop chronic hepatitis which can
result in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Patients
with chronic hepatitis C are infectious, and HCV is most efficiently transmitted
by direct percutaneous exposure to infected blood or intravenous drug use.
Treatment using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is effective but costly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated with antiviral
medications.</p>

<p><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>Globally, it is estimated the approximately 290,000 people died from hepatitis
C, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in 2019. The highest
burden of disease is in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and European Region,
followed by South-East Asia Region and the Western Pacific Region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prevalence of HCV in Singapore is estimated to be around 0.1% of the
general population, and 2% among persons with HIV infection, mostly among
injecting drug users (IDUs). There were 18 cases of acute hepatitis C reported
in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>Parenteral spread accounts for the majority of cases through shared needles/syringes
in IDUs, transfusion of blood or blood products (pre-1990s), renal dialysis,
needle-stick injury or sharing a razor with an infected individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexual transmission occurs at a low rate (generally &lt;1% per year of
relationship, or about 2% of spouses in long term relationships) but these
rates increase if the index patient is also infected with HIV. There has
been a steadily rising incidence of acute HCV in MSM in some parts of the
world which is largely linked to HIV coinfection, presence of other STIs
including syphilis and LGV, traumatic anal sex and use of recreational
drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vertical (mother to infant) spread also occurs at a low rate (about 5%
or less), but higher rates (up to 40%) are seen if the woman is both HIV-
and HCV-positive. In all groups, transmission risk correlates with the
presence of detectable HCVRNA in the mother’s blood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> 4 to 20 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>One or more weeks before symptoms
develop in the acute stage; lifelong in chronic infection.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>Persons newly infected with HCV typically are either asymptomatic or have
a mild clinical illness.&nbsp;Cases of acute icteric hepatitis is uncommon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complications:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute fulminant hepatitis is rare
(&lt;1% of all hepatitis C infections), but is more common after hepatitis
A superinfection of chronic hepatitis C carriers</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 50-85% of infected
patients become <u>chronic carriers</u>, a state which is normally asymptomatic
but may cause nonspecific ill health. Type 1 genotype is more likely to
clear spontaneously but leads to more severe chronic infection. Once established,
the chronic carrier state rarely resolves spontaneously (0.02%/year). Symptoms
and/or signs are worse if there is a high alcohol intake or other liver
disease. Significant liver disease can be present in the 35% of carriers
who have normal serum ALT levels</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mortality in acute hepatitis is
very low (&lt;1%) but up to 30% of chronic carriers will progress to severe
liver disease after 14-30 years of infection, with an increased risk of
liver cancer (approximately 14% of all patients and up to 33% of those
with cirrhosis). HIV coinfection also worsens the prognosis although this
may be ameliorated to some degree by ART.</p>

<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>
</p>
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unprotected sex with
a person who has HCV or is co-infected with HCV and HIV</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having multiple sex
partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inconsistent condom
use if the relationship is not monogamous</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past history or current
presence of other STIs</p>

<p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IVDU) are
considered at risk groups for HCV acquisition.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Screening ELISA, confirmatory
test e.g. recombinant immuno-blot assay (RIBA), third generation immunoassay
or HCV-PCR for RNA. In HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 count (&lt;200
cells/mm 3) the EIA may be negative and an HCV-PCR may be needed for diagnosis</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HCV-RNA will be positive
after 2 weeks. HCV serology is usually positive (90%) 3 months after exposure
but can take as long as 9 months</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic infection is
confirmed if HCV-RNA assay is positive 6 months after the first positive
test. All patients being considered for therapy should have a viral RNA
test to confirm viraemia and genotype assay</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Treatment and Management</p>
<p>All HCV-positive patients should be referred to a liver specialist for
consideration of treatment. Patients with hepatitis C should be vaccinated
against hepatitis A and B, given the high rate of fulminant hepatitis in
co-infection hepatitis A and C and the worse prognosis of hepatitis B and
C co-infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acute hepatitis C infection is defined as the first six months of HCV
infection following HCV exposure. However, most acute HCV infection goes
undetected because the majority are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the advent and efficacy of direct acting antiviral (DAA) regimens
for chronic HCV infection, there is less urgency to treat acute HCV infection.
The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends waiting six
months to evaluate for spontaneous clearance of HCV before considering
initiating DAA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following situations, treatment during acute phase may be preferable:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients as risk of
complications of HCV such as those with severe disease or have other comorbid
liver disease</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients who pose a
high risk of transmission to others</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Considerations in pregnancy and breastfeeding:</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine testing for
HCV infection is not recommended for all pregnant women. Pregnant women
with a known risk factor for HCV infection should be offered counselling
and testing</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is at present
no known way of reducing the risk of vertical transmission. Women should
be informed of the potential risk of transmission in pregnancy</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breast feeding: there
is no firm evidence of additional risk of transmission except, perhaps
in women who are symptomatic with a high viral load</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>Hepatitis C screening should be considered in all IDUs, especially if
equipment has been shared, in people sustaining a needle-stick injury if
the donor HCV status is positive or unknown, sexual partners of HCV positive
individuals, MSM, all HIV-positive patients, female sex workers, tattoo
recipients, alcoholics and ex-prisoners. Routine periodic HCV testing is
also recommended for persons with ongoing risk factors (e.g., injecting
drug use or hemodialysis).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is currently no available vaccine or immunoglobulin preparation
that will prevent transmission. Way to prevent hepatitis C include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistent and correct
use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit the number of
sex partners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid sharing needles
or any equipment used for injecting drugs, piercing, or tattooing</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe and appropriate
use of healthcare injections</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe handling and disposal
of needles and medical waste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of sexual contacts:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner notification should be performed.
Contact tracing to include any sexual contact (penetrative vaginal or anal
sex) or needle sharing partners during the period in which the index case
is thought to have been infectious. The infectious period is from 2 weeks
before the onset of jaundice in acute infection, or trace back to the likely
time of infection (e.g. blood transfusion, first needle sharing) although
this may be impractical for periods longer than two or three years. Consider
testing children born to infectious women.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual transmission should be discussed.
It seems likely that if condoms are used consistently, then sexual transmission
will be avoided.</p>
