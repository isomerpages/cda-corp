<h2>Understanding Hepatitis C (HCV): Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments</h2>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV)</p>

<summary><strong>What is HCV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver caused by the Hepatitis C
virus (HCV). HCV infection may result in acute (short-term) hepatitis,
but may also be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Many infected people develop chronic hepatitis, which may lead to liver
diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine for HCV, but it can be treated with antiviral medications.
Treatment using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is effective but costly.</p>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is HCV Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HCV is usually spread through blood from an infected person. This can
happen through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sharing drug injection equipment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unregulated tattoos or body piercings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure from hospitals through improper handling of fluids;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing personal items; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood transfusions and organ transplants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of HCV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Many people with HCV do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they usually
appear within two to 12 weeks, but can take up to six months to develop,
and is usually a sign of advanced liver disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms can include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Jaundice;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor appetite;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upset stomach, stomach pain;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vomiting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dark-coloured urine;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light-coloured stool;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint pain; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms could worsen if the infected person has high alcohol intake
or other liver diseases.</p>
<p>Approximately 50%–85% of HCV patients become carriers. They are normally
asymptomatic but they can transmit the virus. Up to 30% of carriers could
progress to severe liver disease after 14 to 30 years of being infected
if HCV is not managed properly.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Risk Factors?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having multiple sexual partners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex between men ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being an intravenous drug user ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent condom use; and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History or current presence of other STIs.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How to Treat HCV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Like Hepatitis B (HBV), HCV is treated in collaboration with a hepatologist,
a doctor who specialises in acute or chronic treating liver diseases.</p>
<p>In addition, people with HCV are recommended to get Hepatitis A and B
vaccinations to reduce the risk of co-infection.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding considerations include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Routine testing for HCV infection is not recommended for all pregnant
women. Pregnant women with a known risk factor for HCV infection should
be offered counselling and testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is at present no known way of reducing the risk of vertical transmission.
Women should be informed of the potential risk of transmission in pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no firm evidence of transmission through breastfeeding except
in women living with HCV, who are symptomatic with a high viral load.</p>
