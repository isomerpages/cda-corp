<summary><strong>What is Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is a common childhood disease that is generally mild and self-limiting.
HFMD is endemic in Singapore and can affect all ages but young children
are more susceptible, especially those below 5 years of age who constitute
the at-risk population. HFMD is caused by viruses in the Enteroviruses
group (e.g. coxsackieviruses, echovirus, and enterovirus A71).</p>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is HFMD Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HFMD is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, direct contact with respiratory
droplets, saliva, vesicular fluid or indirectly via contaminated surfaces.</p>
<p>The incubation period is about 3 to 5 days, ranging from 2 to 14 days.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the symptoms of HFMD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A person with HFMD usually presents with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sore throat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rash (flat or raised red spots) or small blisters on palms of hands, soles
of feet, or buttocks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouth ulcers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lethargy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The clinical presentation may vary between individuals, and at different
stages of the disease (e.g. some may only have a rash or some individuals
may show no symptoms at all).</p>
<p>Young children are at higher risk of serious infection. If you suspect
your child has HFMD, and symptoms are accompanied by changes in their normal
behaviour, like drowsiness, persistent vomiting or refusal to eat/drink,
take your child to visit a medical practitioner.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the potential complications of HFMD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">

the nervous system, respiratory system and heart can occur, but are rare.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Treat HFMD?</strong>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent HFMD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To prevent the spread of HFMD, one is strongly encouraged to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observe and practise good personal hygiene at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands regularly with soap, especially before handling food or
eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirty from coughing
or sneezing. If water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser
that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and dispose
the soiled tissue into the bin immediately. Avoid touching your face, including
eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands after coughing or sneezing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sharing of food/drinks or eating utensils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear a mask and seek medical attention promptly when unwell.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>In high-risk settings such as childcare centres and preschools, HFMD outbreaks
can be prevented by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Early identification and isolation of cases. Unwell staff or children
should be sent home and seek medical treatment immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents should inform their childâ€™s school immediately if their child
has HFMD, so that other children can be closely monitored for symptoms
and additional precautions can be taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unwell children and staff should stay at home until blisters have dried
up, or until they have fully recovered, or after the expiry of the medical
certificate (MC) given by the medical practitioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper cleaning and disinfection of communal areas and potentially contaminated
items (e.g. toys or appliances) should be conducted regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
