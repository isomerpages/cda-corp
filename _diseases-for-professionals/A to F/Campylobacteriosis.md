<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Campylobacter is a bacterial microbe that causes food poisoning in humans.
It can be found in raw poultry and meat, unpasteurised milk, and untreated
water. It can also be found in pets like cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Campylobacter is usually transmitted through consuming undercooked meats
and meat products, as well as contaminated milk, water or ice. Thorough
cooking of food and pasteurisation of milk will destroy Campylobacteriosis.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Campylobacter</em> is an important cause of diarrhoeal illness worldwide
and a major cause of traveller’s diarrhoea. In developed countries, males
and children younger than 5 years have the highest incidence of illness,
though all age groups can be affected.</p>

<summary><strong>Pathogen(s)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni </em>and less commonly, <em>Campylobacter coli</em>.
There are 18 other species that can also cause infection.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Campylobacteriosis usually occurs through consumption of undercooked food
(notably poultry), unpasteurised milk and contaminated food or water. Transmission
can also occur via direct contact with infected animals (e.g. farm animals,
domestic pets) or animal products.</p>
<p>Incubation period: Typically, 2-5 days; range is 1-10 days.</p>
<p>Infectious period: While organisms can be excreted in the faeces for 2-7
weeks, person-to-person transmission is uncommon.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Symptoms can be clinically indistinguishable from other foodborne illnesses.
Majority of cases present with abdominal pain and diarrhoea (which may
be bloody). There may be a prodromal period of fever and malaise a day
preceding gastrointestinal symptoms. The symptoms typically last several
days to 2 weeks (average 7 days).</p>
<p>Rare late onset complications include reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barré
syndrome.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The key risk factors for Campylobacter infection include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Farm workers and abattoir workers handling poultry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food handlers of raw poultry.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Campylobacter</em> infection can be diagnosed when a culture detects <em>Campylobacter </em>species<em> </em>in
stool samples.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Campylobacteriosis is usually mild and self-limiting. Treatment is generally
supportive.</p>
<p>Antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin) are not indicated except for patients
with severe symptoms or at risk of invasive disease. Features of severe
disease include bloody stools, high fever, extra-intestinal infection or
symptoms lasting more than a week.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard and contact precautions (if active diarrhoea) apply in the healthcare
setting. There is no available vaccine.</p>
<p>Infected individuals should not prepare or handle food until symptoms
have resolved. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. Unpasteurised dairy
products should be avoided. Utensils and cutting boards used to handle
raw poultry should be washed thoroughly. The same cutting board should
not be used for both raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
