<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Listeria monocytogenes is a micro-organism that causes food poisoning.
It can be found in soil, vegetation, raw milk, meat, poultry, cheeses (particularly
soft mould-ripened varieties) and salads. It is also found in the guts
of animals and humans. Unlike most other food poisoning bacteria, it can
grow at low temperatures, even in the fridge. However, thorough cooking
of food and pasteurisation of milk will destroy Listeria.</p>
<p>Symptoms can range from mild flu-like illness to meningitis and septicaemia;
and in pregnant women, abortion, miscarriage or birth of an infected child.
Other susceptible groups are those with weak immune systems, the young
and the old.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>Listeria</em> is found primarily in the environment (soil, water, decaying
vegetation). It can also be found in the faeces of animals and asymptomatic
humans. <em>Listeria</em> can multiply in refrigerated food unlike most other
foodborne pathogens.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic faecal carriage is common, even without a known exposure.
Carriage rate estimates can be much higher among slaughterhouse workers,
laboratory workers who work with <em>L. </em>monocytogenes cultures, and
in asymptomatic household contacts of persons with invasive listeriosis.
Infected individuals can shed the organism.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Usually foodborne transmission. Commonly implicated food products include
dairy products (especially soft cheeses, made from raw/unpasteurised milk),
processed and delicatessen meats (e.g. hot dogs, deli meats, cold processed
meat), raw mushrooms, fresh produce including fruits and vegetables and
seafood.</p>
<p>In neonatal infections, transmission is almost always from mother to foetus.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> dependent on severity</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Non-invasive listeriosis: few days; range is 6 hours-10 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invasive listeriosis: 1 – 2 weeks; range is 3-70 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> Not generally considered infectious
(except for vertical transmission that occurs in neonatal infections).</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In healthy individuals, listeriosis presents as a self-limiting febrile
gastroenteritis and is rarely invasive. Invasive listeriosis is more common
in individuals who are immunocompromised, elderly, pregnant, and in neonates.
It usually presents as septicaemia or meningoencephalitis. Rarely, focal
infections (e.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis) can occur.</p>
<p>Listeriosis in pregnant women can be asymptomatic or experienced as a
mild flu-like illness. However, it can lead to foetal infection and result
in foetal death, preterm delivery and neonatal infection. Neonatal listeriosis
usually presents as sepsis (granulomatosis infantiseptica) or meningitis.
CFR for neonatal infection is 20–30%.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The key risk factors for Listeriosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consumption of uncooked or contaminated food such as unpasteurized (raw)
dairy products (e.g. raw goat’s milk, raw cheese), soft cheese including
those ripened by mould (e.g., B. Romadur and Roquefort), refrigerated meat
spread (e.g. pâté), ready-to-eat deli meats and sausages, and smoked fish
(salmon).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Listeriosis infection can be diagnosed when a culture detects Listeria
species in a person’s blood, cerebrospinal fluid, sterile fluids or amniotic
fluid/swab.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Immunocompetent patients with non-invasive listeriosis do not generally
require antibiotics as the gastroenteritis is self-limiting. Patients at
high risk and those with invasive listeriosis are treated with antibiotics
(penicillins are the drug of choice).</p>
<p>Delays in initiating antibiotics should be avoided as it has been associated
with poorer outcomes. Severe cases will require hospitalization.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard precautions apply in healthcare settings. There is no available
vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to proper food handling practices (which is also applicable
to prevention of other foodborne illness), individuals at high risk for
invasive listeriosis (e.g. pregnant, immunocompromised) should avoid uncooked
meats, soft cheeses, deli meats, meat spreads and smoked seafood.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Notification</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Listeriosis is not a legally notifiable disease in Singapore. However,
if there are clusters of public health concerns, they should be notified
to MOH through CD Lens (other significant disease).</p>
