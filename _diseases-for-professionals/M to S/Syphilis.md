<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Syphilis is a systemic infection caused by <em>Treponema pallidum</em>.
It is a preventable and curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection
(STI).</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 7.1 million
adults aged 15 to 49 were diagnosed with syphilis worldwide. Some population
groups are disproportionately affected by syphilis, such as men who have
sex with men (MSM). This could be attributed to various factors, including
elevated levels of stigma and discrimination, as well as limited access
to healthcare services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the notified syphilis cases, the incidence rate of infectious syphilis
decreased from 8.6 per 100,000 population in 2019 to 5.1 in 2020 in Singapore;
and there were no cases of congenital syphilis in 2019 and two cases in
2020.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Syphilis is transmitted during oral, anal, or vaginal sex through direct
contact with infectious lesions.</p>
<p>An infected mother can also pass syphilis during pregnancy through the
placenta.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period: &nbsp;</strong>From 10–90 days, with an average
of 21 days.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period: </strong>During the primary and secondary stages
and possibly the first two years of the latent period. A person is no longer
infectious five days after starting appropriate antibiotic treatment or
until their symptoms resolve.</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Many people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms.</p>
<p>Syphilis has several stages:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary syphilis: Usually occurs 2–6 weeks following infection. Characterised
by a single or less often multiple, painless, indurated ulcer (chancre)
at the site of inoculation. Regional lymph nodes are enlarged, feel rubbery
and are painless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary syphilis<strong>:</strong> Usually occurs 2–6 months following
primary syphilis. Characterised by variable mucocutaneous and systemic
signs e.g. symmetrical non-itchy rashes, mucous membrane lesions, patchy
alopecia, generalised lymphadenopathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latent syphilis: Asymptomatic phase with no clinical signs of organ involvement.
It is categorised into:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Early latent syphilis (less than one year of infection); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late latent syphilis (more than one year of infection).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tertiary Syphilis: Occurs 5–10 years after secondary syphilis and includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Benign tertiary syphilis characterised by gumma formation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cardiovascular syphilis; or</p>

<li>
<p>Neurosyphilis.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Risk factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unprotected sex with an infected person;</p>

<li>
<p>Having multiple sex partners;</p>
</li>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>T. pallidum </em>cannot be cultured on routine laboratory culture
media. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for <em>T. pallidum </em>DNA
is not commercially available.</p>
<p>Tests for diagnosis include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dark-Field Microscopy (DFM): Useful in early syphilis when antibodies
are not yet detectable. The diagnosis of syphilis may be confirmed by demonstrating <em>T. pallidum </em>on
wet mounts of secretions from the primary chancre, or moist lesions of
secondary syphilis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serological tests:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Non-Treponemal Tests (</u><em>Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) </em>test and
the <em>Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) </em>test) are monitored
serially to assess the serological response to treatment. A positive RPR/VDRL
test needs to be confirmed by a treponemal test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Treponemal Tests (</u><em>Treponema Pallidum Haemagglutination Assay (TPHA)</em>, <em>Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination (TPPA) </em>test,
the <em>Line Immunoassay (LIA)</em>, the <em>Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-Abs</em>)
test, Rapid diagnostic tests (e.g. <em>Abbott Determine Syphilis TP</em>)
and the <em>treponemal EIA </em>test) are specific and can be used as screening
tests. Once positive, specific tests tend to remain positive even after
the syphilis has been successfully treated. The titres of treponemal tests
are not useful in monitoring treatment response.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Parenteral penicillin G (aqueous crystalline, aqueous procaine, or benzathine)
is the drug of choice for treating all stages of syphilis. If the patient
is allergic to penicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, and
erythromycin are the alternatives. However, they do not have the established
and well-evaluated high rate of success of penicillin.</p>
<p>Recommended regimens for primary, secondary, or early latent:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly (IM) single
dose; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aq. Procaine Penicillin G 600,000 units IM daily for 10 days.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended regimens for late latent:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly, 3 doses (7.2 million
units total); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aq. Procaine penicillin G 600,000 units IM daily for 17–21 days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<p>Quantitative nontreponemal tests should be repeated for a total period
of two years, at three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months).</p>
<p>Following treatment of early syphilis, RPR/VDRL should demonstrate a four
time (two dilutions) decrease in titre within six months. Failure to do
so probably means treatment failure, and is an indication for retreatment
with three injections of Benzathine penicillin. Some experts recommend
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation.</p>
<p>Clinical signs that persist or recur, or a rising RPR/VDRL titre of four
times or more suggests either reinfection or relapse. In these situations,
CSF examination is recommended before retreatment. Seroreversion in primary
syphilis often occurs within 12 months. It may take a longer time for secondary
and early latent syphilis, but usually occurs within 24 months.</p>
<p>For latent syphilis non-treponemal tests should be repeated at six, 12,
and 24 months. Serologic response to treatment associated with multiple
factors, viz. syphilis stage, initial non-treponemal titres (less than
1:8 are less likely to decline four-fold), and age (titres in older patients
might be less likely to decrease fourfold than younger patients). These
persons should be examined for HIV infection and neurologic disease, clinical
and serologic follow-up annually. If additional follow-up cannot be ensured
or if an initially high titre (more than 1:32) does not decrease at least
four-fold 24 months after treatment, retreatment with weekly injections
of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for three weeks is recommended.
Because treatment failure might be the result of unrecognised CNS infection,
CSF examination can be considered in such situations where follow-up is
uncertain or initial high titres do not decrease after 24 months.</p>
<p>Following treatment of late syphilis, seroreversion occurs rarely as a
stable, low titre, serological scar, is the result in most patients.</p>
<p>All patients treated for neurosyphilis should be followed up for life
at six-month intervals. If CSF pleocytosis was present initially, CSF examinations
should be repeated every six to 12 months until the cell count returns
to normal. Serologic tests for HIV should be performed three months after
the last risky exposure.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Annual or more frequent screening for syphilis symptoms and other STIs
is recommended for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individuals with multiple sex partners, change in sex partner, or engaging
in unprotected sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All pregnant women in their first prenatal visit; and thereafter, if there
is risk of infection from their regular partner; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals who are at risk depending on their risk behaviours</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prevention of syphilis:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inform current or recent sexual partners if a syphilis diagnosis has been
confirmed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not having sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for STIs regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<p>At risk partners are those who have been exposed within the following
periods:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>3 months, plus duration of symptoms for primary syphilis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 months, plus duration of symptoms for secondary syphilis; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 year for early latent syphilis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Epidemiologic treatment should be given to sexual contacts who were exposed
three months prior to the diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent
syphilis, if follow-up is uncertain. Sexual partners of late syphilis should
be screened and evaluated for syphilis, and treated on the basis of these
findings.</p>
