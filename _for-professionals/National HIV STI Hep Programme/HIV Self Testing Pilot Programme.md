<p>&nbsp;In Singapore, most of the newly diagnosed HIV infections continue
to be detected during the course of clinical care and typically at a late
stage of HIV infection, with a very low proportion diagnosed from self-initiated
testing. In addition, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncid.sg/About-NCID/OurDepartments/Documents/HIV%20Testing%20Recommendations_clean_FINAL_221021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National HIV Testing Recommendations</a>&nbsp;recommend
that every adult at the age of 21 years and above should be tested at least
once in their life regardless of risk factors, and people at higher risk
of HIV infection should be tested more frequently.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to know their HIV status is encouraged to get tested.
The National HIV Programme, together with our partners at Department of
Sexually Transmitted Infections Control (DSC) Clinic and Action for AIDS
(AfA), have introduced HIV self-testing to complement existing testing
modalities in Singapore. The pilot programme aims to encourage individuals
at risk to be tested, in turn increasing early diagnosis and early treatment
for persons living with HIV. Under the pilot programme, HIV self-testing
kits can be purchased from DSC and AfA by individuals above 21 years old
and administered in the privacy of the individual's home from 1 August
2022.</p>
