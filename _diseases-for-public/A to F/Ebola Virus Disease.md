<summary><strong>What is EVD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), previously known as Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever,
is a rare disease which causes severe, often fatal illness in humans.</p>
<p>There have been several Ebola outbreaks in Africa since the disease first
appeared in 1976. The disease affects humans and non-human primates (e.g.
monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). The origin of the virus is unknown
but fruit bats are considered the likely host of the Ebola virus.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>How is EVD Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blood or body fluids (urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk,
semen) of an infected person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and syringes) that are contaminated
with infected body fluids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood or body fluids of infected animals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The incubation period is about 2 to 21 days.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of EVD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The following symptoms of EVD are commonly experienced at the beginning
of the disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sudden onset of fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intense weakness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sore throat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What are the potential complications of EVD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As EVD progresses, infected persons commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea,
rash, impaired kidney, and liver dysfunction and in some cases, bleeding.</p>

<summary><strong>How to Prevent EVD?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To reduce risk of exposure to Ebola, we advise travellers to maintain
their vigilance and adopt the following health precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observe and practise good personal hygiene at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands regularly with soap, especially before handling food or
eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirty. If water is
not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser that contains at least
60% alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid close contact with persons who are unwell or have symptoms of infectious
diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid contact with wild animals, including bats, monkeys, apes, chimpanzee
and gorillas, whether alive or dead, including their raw or undercooked
meat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid participating in burial ceremonies which require direct contact
with the body of a deceased infected person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning travellers from countries with reported EVD activity or travellers
who suspect that they have been exposed to EVD should seek immediate medical
attention if they develop any symptoms (i.e. sudden onset of high fever,
stomach pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash or bleeding). They should inform
their doctor of their recent travel or contact history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with EVD are managed with symptomatic treatment and supportive
care. If diagnosed and managed early, these can significantly improve the
chances of survival.</p>
<p>There are two vaccines for Ebola disease caused by the Zaire species (i.e. <em>Orthoebolavirus zairense</em>).
They are limited in supply and only available for restricted use.</p>
