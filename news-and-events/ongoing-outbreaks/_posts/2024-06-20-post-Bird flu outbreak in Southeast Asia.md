<p>Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a highly contagious viral
infection that primarily affects birds. However, in rare cases, it can
spread to humans and cause severe illness.</p>
<p>As of June 20, 2024, Southeast Asia faces a wave of highly pathogenic
H5N1 avian influenza. Cambodia reported the most concerning cases, with
six human infections linked to the virus, one of which resulted in death.
This outbreak involved a reassortant strain of H5N1, raising concerns due
to its potential for adaptation.</p>
<p>While there haven't been recent reports of large-scale outbreaks in the
region, public health officials remain vigilant. Continued surveillance
in poultry farms and awareness campaigns for those working with birds are
crucial to prevent further spread and potential human infections.</p>
<p>Symptoms of bird flu in humans can include fever, cough, sore throat,
muscle aches, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, the infection
can lead to pneumonia and even death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect yourself from bird flu, it is important to practice good hygiene,
such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with sick or
dead birds. If you experience any flu-like symptoms after being exposed
to sick birds, seek medical attention immediately.</p>
