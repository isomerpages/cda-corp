<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection
(STI). There are more than 100 subtypes of HPV, which are categorised into
high-risk and low-risk types. Oncogenic, high-risk HPV infection (e.g.,
HPV types 16 and 18) causes the majority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal,
anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers, whereas other HPV infection
(e.g., HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis.</p>
<p>HPV infections are common and most infections do not result in clinically
visible genital tract lesions. Cancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccination.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>From 2019 data, it was estimated that 620,000 new cases of cancer in women
and 70,000 in men were attributed to HPV globally. Cervical cancer, which
ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancer and cancer-related deaths
in women in 2022, accounted for approximately 660,000 new cases and around
350,000 deaths worldwide. Cervical cancers make up more than 90% of HPV-related
cancers in women. In Singapore, cervical cancer is the 10<sup>th</sup> most
common cancer among women.</p>
<p>The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed
in low- and middle-income countries, underscoring significant disparities
resulting from limited access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening,
treatment services, and broader social and economic factors.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the virus is higher among women with HIV, men who have
sex with men (MSM), individuals with compromised immune systems, those
with co-infections of other STIs, individuals receiving immunosuppressive
medications, and children who have experienced sexual abuse.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission can occur during oral, vaginal, and anal sex and other intimate
skin-to-skin contact.<sup> </sup>HPV 6 and 11 are transmitted predominantly
by epithelial contact. HPV can spread even when a person with infection
has no signs or symptoms.</p>
<p>Incubation period:<strong> </strong>2–3 months, with a range of 1–20 months
for genital warts</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>HPV infection occurs as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Clinical Lesions:</strong> condylomata acuminata, papular and flat
warts;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Condyloma acuminata: exophytic, filiform, cauliflower-shaped warts, HPV
6 and 11 in more than 90% of cases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multifocal: usually 5–15 lesions, in areas of trauma during sex, 1–10
mm diameter, may coalesce, especially in immunosuppressed individuals and
in the presence of diabetes mellitus;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May be coinfected with oncogenic “high-risk” HPV e.g. HPV 16 and 18; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oncogenic HPV: mostly give rise to subclinical lesions, intraepithelial
neoplasia (IN), and anogenital cancer.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Subclinical Lesions</strong>: Only visible after application of
acetic acid and magnification; or</p>

<p>Latent HPV infection defined when HPV DNA can be demonstrated in absence
of clinical or histological evidence of infection.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Onset of sexual intercourse at an early age;</p>

<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A clinical diagnosis is made from recognition of characteristic lesions.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Subclinical mucosal warts can be identified by turning white (acetowhite)
after application of 5% acetic acid for three minutes. This can be applied
onto discrete as well as suspected sub-clinical lesions; the mechanism
for this aceto-whitening effect is not clear. One hypothesis is that acetic
acid causes a reversible coagulation of some epithelial and stromal proteins.
Note that this whitening effect may also occur in areas of abrasions or
non-specific inflammation, and may also be seen in other infections such
as candidiasis, and thus is not specific for HPV infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin biopsy is indicated for atypical cases, cases where the benign nature
of papular or macular lesions is unclear. Features which may raise suspicion
include pigmentation, depigmentation, pruritus, immunodeficiency, and history
of intraepithelial neoplasia. Biopsy may also be indicated when the lesions
do not respond to or worsen during standard therapy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a clinical diagnosis has been made, HPV testing is not recommended
to confirm anogenital wart diagnosis.</p>

<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Treatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) or pathologic
precancerous lesions caused by HPV. While subclinical genital HPV infection
typically clears spontaneously, treatment can be given to remove visible
exophytic warts. No treatment, however, is completely satisfactory in eliminating
HPV infection.</p>
<p>It is important to perform meatoscopy for meatal warts, proctoscopy for
anal warts, and speculum examination with cervical cytology/colposcopy
for female genital warts.</p>
<p>Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical cancer screening; HPV-related
precancer should be managed based on national guidelines.</p>
<p>Follow-up:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide clear information: causes, treatment, outcomes, and possible complications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise smoking cessation for recalcitrant warts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular cervical cytology (PAP smears) for females.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Condoms: with new partners till clearance is achieved; regular partner
already exposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long latency periods mean that only one partner in a relationship may
manifest warts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current partners and recent partners within 6 months should be assessed
for HPV and other STIs.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention, and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All women who have had sex should undergo screening for cervical cancer
from the age of 25. According to the national cancer <a href="https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5c4817_fi_59.pdf&amp;ofile=STRC+Report+March+2019.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">screening guidelines</a>,
the recommended screening interval is as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Age 25–29 years: Pap smear screening once every 3 years. Primary HPV testing
is not recommended for women in this age group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age 30–69 years: HPV testing once every 5 years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prevention of HPV:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Not having sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent and correct use of condoms when engaging in sexual activity;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of sex partners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undergo cervical cancer screening regularly; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HPV vaccines are recommended to all females between ages9–26 years.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Three HPV vaccines are available for prevention:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A bivalent vaccine (Cervarix), which protects against HPV 16 and 18</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil-4), which protects against HPV 6, 11,
16, and 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nonavalent (9-valent) vaccine (Gardasil-9), which protects against HPV
6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Management of sexual contacts</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Patients should inform current partners about having genital warts because
the types of HPV that cause warts can also be transmitted to partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partners should be counselled&nbsp;on the possibility of having HPV despite
no visible signs of warts; therefore, HPV testing of sex partners of persons
with genital warts is not recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partners might benefit from a physical examination to detect genital warts
and tests for other STIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex partners
about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration of viral persistence
after resolution of warts is unknown.</p>
