<p><strong>Overview/Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Mpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the
genus Orthopoxvirus. Two different clades exist: clade I and clade II.</p>

<p><strong>Disease epidemiology</strong>
</p>
<p>Mpox was historically known to be endemic in Central and Western Africa.
However, a global outbreak was first identified in May 2022, where cases
were reported in several locations that had not experienced with mpox.
Most cases were primarily driven by human-to-human close (including sexual)
contact. Globally, the number of mpox cases peaked in August 2022 and has
been on a downward trend. According to CDC’s 2022-2023 Mpox data, a cumulative
total of 93,500 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases has been reported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of December 2023, there were a total of 29 confirmed mpox cases reported
in Singapore (excluding an isolated case of mpox diagnosed in 2022).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 23 July 22, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing
outbreak of mpox to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC).</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong>
</p>
<p>Spread of mpox may occur when a person comes into close contact with an
infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir
for transmission to humans) in areas where there are animal reservoirs
(i.e. West and Central Africa), or more commonly, another infected human
(which is the most common mode in the 2022 outbreak), or materials contaminated
with the virus. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if
breaks are not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes
(eyes, nose, or mouth or anogenital mucosa).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside West and Central Africa, the ongoing outbreak of mpox has primarily
affected men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Up to 21 days (usually 6 to 16 days)</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> From onset of symptoms, until after
all the scabs on the skin have fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin
has formed underneath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>
</p>
<p>In 'classic' mpox, the majority (&gt;70%) of infected persons are symptomatic,
and early symptoms of mpox include: fever, headache, muscle ache, backache,
lymphadenopathy, and a general feeling of exhaustion (asthenia). Within
1 to 3 days after the onset of fever, infected persons will develop a maculopapular
rash, often starting from the face before becoming generalised (centrifugal
distribution), including involvement of palms and soles in up to 75% of
cases. The lesions progress to become vesicles and then pustules, before
crusting occurs in approximately 10 days, which then spontaneously fall
off. The disease is typically self-limiting, with symptoms usually resolving
spontaneously within 14 to 21 days. However, the infection can be fatal,
particularly in young children, with a reported mortality rate of 1% to
10% during outbreaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2022 outbreak, presentation has often been more atypical and variable
in terms of order of onset of fever versus rash, and extent of dissemination
of rash. The disease caused by mpox in the global 2022 outbreak has been
milder than in ‘classic’ mpox as the virus subtype (known as ‘clade’) is
different. &nbsp;About 72% of cases report prodromal systemic symptoms
(e.g. fever, fatigue, muscle aches). Anal and genital lesions are reported
commonly, and lesions may initially appear quite non-specific.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atypical features include:</p>
<p>1) Only a few or even just a single lesion, lesions which begin in the
genital or perineal/perianal area and do not spread further.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Lesions appearing at different (asynchronous) stages of development.</p>
<p>3) Appearance of lesions before the onset of fever, malaise and other
constitutional symptoms.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;Symptomatology may masquerade as other sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), and mpox may occur concurrently with other STIs. Patients remain
infectious from the onset of fever until the vesicles/lesions have scabbed
over and have separated, with normal skin underneath (re-epithelialisation).</p>

<p><strong>Risk factors</strong>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact with infected

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close contact with confirmed
cases, including history of sexual or intimate in-person contact with persons

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>The diagnosis of mpox can be confirmed by testing by PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) which is a type of molecular test performed at the National Public
Health Laboratory (NPHL). When a case is suspected, clinicians should contact
the NPHL via their hospital's diagnostic laboratories and send swabs from
vesicles (throat swabs and blood are less preferred alternative due to
lower sensitivity) in a dry and sterile tube (without universal transport
medium) for further diagnostic testing.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</p>
<p>Mpox is typically a self-limiting illness and most mpox patients usually
recover within two to four weeks, although serious illness and complications
may occur especially in vulnerable persons (e.g. young children, pregnant
women or immunocompromised individuals). Usually, no specific antiviral
treatment is required for majority of cases, and clinical management is
supportive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspect and confirmed mpox cases should be isolated, preferably in a negative
pressure isolation (NEP) room, if admitted. Healthcare workers caring for
these cases should practice strict hand hygiene and don personal protective
equipment including disposable gowns, gloves, N95 masks or equivalent,
as well as eye protection.</p>

<p><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</p>
<p>Members of the public are strongly advised to maintain vigilance and take
the following precautions:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor your health
and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand
washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid contact with persons
who are unwell and objects that may have become contaminated with infectious
fluids such as soiled clothing, bedding, or towels</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid high-risk sexual
activity, such as having multiple sex partners or casual sex</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When travelling, avoid
contact with wild animals that could harbour the virus, and consumption
of bush meat</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek medical attention
immediately if you develop symptoms such as sudden onset of high fever,
swollen lymph nodes and rash, and inform your doctor of any recent travel
or exposure history</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaccination:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MVA-BN (JYNNEOS),&nbsp;a&nbsp;third-generation
smallpox vaccine, is currently available as Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
for&nbsp;persons who have been identified to be close contacts of confirmed
mpox cases, as well as Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for persons at higher
risk of&nbsp;being infected with mpox based on epidemiological factors
in the 2022 outbreak. While JYNNEOS is estimated to provide over 80% protection
against mpox, current data remains limited in concluding the level and
duration of protection conferred by vaccination, and persons are advised
to continue adhering to the recommended precautions against the disease.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with international
recommendations, mass population-wide vaccination is currently not recommended
as a preventive strategy for mpox, as the risk to the general public remains
low with disease transmission predominantly via close physical or prolonged
contact.</p>
