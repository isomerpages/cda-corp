<summary><strong>What is BV?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV is a condition where different types of bacteria affect the acidity
of a vagina. A healthy, normally functioning vagina is acidic, at a pH
of less than 4.5. BV can cause it to be more neutral, up to a pH of 7.0.
BV is common for women aged 15 to 44 years old.</p>
<p>The bacteria typically associated with BV are:</p>
<p>• G. vaginalis;</p>
<p>• Bacteroides spp;</p>
<p>• Prevotella spp.;</p>
<p>• Mobiluncus spp.;</p>
<p>• Ureaplasma urealyticum; and</p>
<p>• Mycoplasma hominis.</p>

<summary><strong>How is BV Transmitted?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it occurs more
commonly in sexually active women. It is unclear how sexual activity affects
BV’s transmission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not get BV from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools.</p>

<summary><strong>What are the Symptoms of BV?&nbsp;</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>BV may be asymptomatic. When symptoms appear, they include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unusual vaginal discharge that is thin and grayish-white;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fishy odour from the vagina, especially after sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itching or irritation around the vagina; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burning sensation during urination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At times, BV will go away without treatment. However, if untreated it
can lead to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Problems in pregnancy (for example, spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery
for pregnant women with BV);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher risk of STIs and HIV; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
