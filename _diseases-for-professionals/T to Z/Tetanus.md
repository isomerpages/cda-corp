<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tetanus is an infection caused by bacteria called&nbsp;<em>Clostridium tetani&nbsp;</em>(<em>C. tetani</em>),
that are found in the environment. Tetanus is an uncommon but very serious
disease that requires immediate treatment in a hospital.</p>

<summary><strong>Disease Epidemiology</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><em>C. tetani </em>spores are ubiquitous in the soil. They are also found
in the gut of some livestock and pets. Infection occurs worldwide and is
more common in agricultural areas where there is likely to be more contact
with animal faeces. It is relatively rare in Singapore and in other developed
countries where immunisation programmes are well established.</p>

<summary><strong>Transmission</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Transmission occurs when spores of <em>C. tetani</em>, which may be found
in the gut of mammals and the environment (soil, dust or manure), enter
the body through breaks in the skin, usually cuts or puncture wounds caused
by contaminated objects.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> Typically 3-21 days; range is 1 day
to several months</p>
<p><strong>Infectious period:</strong> There is no person-to-person transmission</p>

<summary><strong>Clinical Features</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>An exotoxin produced by C. tetani at the site of an injury affects the
motor system and less commonly, the autonomic and sensory system. It causes
hyperactivity of voluntary muscles in the form of rigidity and spasms,
autonomic dysfunction (irritability, restlessness, sweating, tachycardia,
labile blood pressure) and altered sensation (pain and allodynia). Patients
do not have impairment of consciousness or awareness. There are 4 distinct
clinical patterns:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Generalised tetanus: the most common and severe form of tetanus affecting
muscles of the whole body. The classical findings are</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Risus sardonicus (sardonic smile as a result of sustained spasm of facial
muscles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opisthotonus (the backward arching of the column due to rigidity of the
extensor muscles of the neck and back)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board like rigid abdomen which may mimic an acute abdomen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respiratory failure and dysphagia due to rigidity and spasms of the laryngeal
and respiratory muscles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive spatula test – a clinical test that involves touching the posterior
pharyngeal wall with a soft tipped instrument. A positive result is the
reflex spasm of masseters causing a “bite down” action versus a negative
result of a gag reflex (with attempted expulsion of the instrument).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local tetanus: only affecting one extremity or body region but may progress
to generalised tetanus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cephalic tetanus: a localised form of tetanus only involving cranial nerves
e.g. dysphagia, trismus, focal craniopathies. The facial nerve is most
commonly affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neonatal tetanus: Generalised form of tetanus occurring in children aged
&lt;1 month old. This most commonly occurs 5-7 days following birth, often
as a result of non-sterile handling of the neonatal umbilical stump. Features
are similar to those of generalised tetanus, but the disease progresses
more rapidly than in older individuals.</p>

<summary><strong>Risk Factors</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Persons who have never received a tetanus vaccine or who are not up to
date with their 10-year tetanus booster shots at increased risk.</p>
<p>Elderly persons (&gt; 65 years old), persons with diabetes, immunocompromised
or immunosuppressed persons and persons using intravenous drugs are at
higher risk of serious infection.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The diagnosis of tetanus is made based on history, clinical findings and
immunisation history. Laboratory tests are generally not helpful in diagnosis
of tetanus.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Treatment and Management</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There should be adequate wound cleaning and debridement of any inoculating
injury. Human tetanus immune globulin (HTIG) should be given to neutralise
unbound toxin, with part of dose infiltrated into wound. All patients with
active tetanus should be vaccinated (tetanus toxoid should be administered
at a different site from HTIG).Antibiotics are universally recommended.
Metronidazole is the most appropriate antibiotic. Supportive measures are
provided, including medications for control of muscle spasms (e.g. benzodiazepines),
autonomic lability (e.g. magnesium sulphate) and endotracheal intubation
for airway support.</p>

<summary><strong>Precaution, Prevention and Control</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Standard precautions apply in the healthcare setting.</p>
<p>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis: If a person sustains a tetanus-prone wound
and has unknown vaccination status or has not completed the primary vaccination
series, they should receive HTIG up to 21 days following the injury. Tetanus
toxoid vaccination should be given at the same time but at a different
site from HTIG. Refer to the table below.</p>

<p>Vaccination remains the main preventive measure. Tetanus vaccination is
part of both the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (DTaP at 2 months,
4 months, 6 months and 18 months, and Tdap booster at 10-11 years). The
National Adult Immunisation Schedule recommends vaccination for pregnant
women (a dose of Tdap between 16 and 32 weeks of every pregnancy). Adults
should receive a Td booster every 10 years.</p>
